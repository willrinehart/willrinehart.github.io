A collection of traditional figures of rhetoric

**Dialysis &#8211; the either/or figure.**

Alex Parrish begins &#8220;Adaptive Rhetoric: Evolution, Culture, and the Art of Persuasion&#8221; with an artful first move:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  When I first began outlining this book, I explained to one of my colleagues what I wanted to do. I told him that I would be exploring the ways we can examine the influence of both biology and culture on the art of persuasion. After running through most of my stock examples demonstrating biology and culture cooperating or competing to guide human action, telling him about some of the intriguing work being done in the fields of ethology and evolutionary cognitive psychology, and referring some of the more popular &#8216;big idea&#8217; books on the interplay between genes and culture, my fellow student thought for a moments and then, with a look of concerned semirevulsion on his face, replied, &#8220;Wow. Biological reductionism. That&#8217;s gonna be a hard sell!&#8221;

  Whether it is fundamental part odf the human nature to divide issues in half and only allow for one of those halves to be valid, good , or moral, this seems to be one of the tricks our brains use to navigate the world of idea. We also use this method of bifurcating topics to bring other around to our ways of thinking. The rhetorical term for this is dialysis: the presentation of an either/or figure to lead an audience to a certain conclusion (and in the case of biology and culture, it is also a false dilemma)

**Genus and Species** 

As used by Aristotle, genus (γένος) and species were philosophical categories. A genus was a category and a species was a subcategory of a genus. The two terms were just as often applied to inanimate things as to living ones. For example, it would have been nothing unusual to say &#8220;house is a species of the genus building.&#8221; Aristotle defined a thing by specifying its &#8220;τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι,&#8221; which might be rendered in English as the &#8220;what-it-is-to-be&#8221; of that thing i.e., that which makes it what it is. (The Romans translated τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι with the word essentia, which gave rise to the English word essence.) To specify the essence of any given thing, Aristotle stated its genus and its differentia (pl. differentiae), the quality distinguishing it from others in the same genus. For example, he defined human as &#8220;a rational animal&#8221; (animal is the genus and rational, the differentia).
