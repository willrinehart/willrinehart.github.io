My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, Iâ€™m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation.

Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning. 

My work has appeared in a lot of places, so I&#8217;ve tried my best to put everything in my [publications page][1] on this site. This site also hosts my [personal blog][2] and my [digital garden][3], which is under construction. You can also see my work at the [Tech Liberation Front][4], CGO&#8217;s [Benchmark publication][5], and previously, at the [American Action Forum][6].

You can contact me at will at thecgo dot org. Let&#8217;s build something together.
