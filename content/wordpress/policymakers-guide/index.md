What follows is a selected list of my research that can help policymakers understand the promise and perils of the new regulatory landscape in tech.

* * *

Privacy Regulation

  * [Understanding the ADD Act][1] – Senator Marco Rubio introduced the American Data Dissemination Act of 2019 (or the ADD Act) on January 16, kicking off the 116th Congress’s debate over federal privacy legislation. The core of the bill tasks the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with writing a new set of regulations for the information age based on the principles in the Privacy Act of 1974, only updated to apply to Internet businesses. The bill will likely face opposition from Democrats and advocates, since it would create an expansive privacy regime, supersede state laws, and grant the FTC wide latitude in creating new privacy rules.
  * [DETOUR Act Gives Sweeping Powers to FTC][2] &#8211; Senators Mark Warner and Deb Fischer recently introduced the DETOUR Act seeking to “prohibit the usage of exploitative and deceptive practices by large online operators and to promote consumer welfare in the use of behavioral research by such providers.” While the Act’s goals are laudable, it suffers from a crippling fault: ambiguity. Its broad language would give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) legal space to second guess every design decision by online companies, and, in the most expansive possible reading, it would make nearly all large web sites presumptively illegal.
  * [Should the US Adopt the GDPR?][3] – Now that California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is final, Congress will have the opportunity to pass a law that could supersede the CCPA and some are looking to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for guidance. Here are some reasons for not taking that path.

Big Tech Regulation

  * [Breaking Up Big Tech Is Hard to Do][4] – In this Wall Street Journal op-ed, I explain why structural separation will backfire. Breaking up tech companies means that the government would have to split up their teams and their underlying technology. It would also require a legal and regulatory system to keep each targeted company separate from the others’ markets. These restrictions would pose challenges for any company. But for highly integrated tech firms, they’d be a death sentence.
  * [Breaking Up Tech Companies Means Breaking Up Teams And The Underlying Technology][5] – In this companion piece to my WSJ op-ed above, I explore more in depth the difficulties in breaking up tech companies. Breaking up a company is among the most draconian actions that governments can take, and that fact is only amplified in the case of tech companies.

Innovation And Competition

  * [Is There a Kill Zone in Tech?][6] – Recently, Noah Smith explored an emerging question in tech. Is there a kill zone where new and innovative upstarts are being throttled by the biggest players? I&#8217;m skeptical, which is explained in this piece.

The Value of Data

  * [A Dive Into Digital Dividends][7] – California Governor Gavin Newsom recently called for a data dividend “because we recognize that your data has value, and it belongs to you.” The notion that platforms should pay out a portion of their profits to their users has been gaining steam more broadly, as well. But the idea is misplaced for three primary reasons. First, advertising revenue does not equal the value of data. Second, even if data is jointly created, joint control isn’t the most efficient outcome. And finally, consumers already benefit from ad-supported platforms to the tune of $7 trillion a year.
  * [Why A Data Portability Act Might Not Be An Effective Policy Path][8] – Voice in tech, who are more reluctant to regulate directly, have come up with an idea to increase competition: data portability. Most of the proposals for creating data portability, however, miss what makes data valuable, and thus what gives these companies such power. Data isn’t the key to Facebook, Amazon, and Google. Rather, it is the structure and processing tools around the data that drive these platforms. Further, the United States already tried an open-access regime to foster competition in the telecom sector, with lackluster results. Contrary to the standard bearers of this idea, there are very good reasons to think that regulations to create data portability won’t be effective at all.
  * [The Law & Economics of “Owning Your Data”][9] – The properties of data make ownership a difficult prospect. Knowing this, regulators have instead opted for simple restrictions on data use instead of making data completely an individual’s property. Consumer behavior confirms part of this thesis, as many are willing to trade their information for services. Not surprisingly, data ownership, like other data restriction plans, is a costly endeavor. While there is a natural inclination to push for data-ownership policies, implementing these kinds of policies would have a detrimental effect on innovation.

Section 230

  * [The Precedents for Forcing Neutrality on Tech Platforms][10] – This Congress, Republican Senator Josh Hawley proposed legislation that would fundamentally change a key law underpinning the tech economy, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Currently, Section 230 limits the liability of tech companies for the content that traverses across their Internet platforms. This proposal arises from a longstanding concern about media companies and platforms: that they are biased. In fact, if enacted this proposal would not be the first law that attempts to force such neutrality. But such enforced neutrality has met opposition in the Supreme Court, and ironically it could stifle the free speech it seeks to support.

Reviving The OTA

  * [The Political Economy of Expertise][11] – I’ve been skeptical of reviving the OTA in the past and I remain so. In this Cato Unbound piece, I explore the reasons why.

Artificial Intelligence

  * [An AI Innovation Agenda][12] – The AI race is on. Countries, entrepreneurs, and firms across the globe are jockeying to capitalize on artificial intelligence (AI). While it has received much negative publicity, AI creates many opportunities for the economy and country. To ensure that the United States can benefit from the possibilities of these new technologies, policymakers should work toward implementing this AI agenda.
  * [Understanding Job Loss Predictions From Artificial Intelligence][13] – Worries about artificial intelligence (AI) tend to emanate from concerns about the impact of the new technology on work. Many fear that automation will destabilize labor markets, depress wage growth, and lead to long-term secular decline in the labor market and economy as a whole. Policymakers should know that (1) similar models charting AI job loss can result in widely different job prediction losses; (2) most AI job loss predictions aren’t compared against current economic baselines; and (3) implementing AI-based systems isn’t costless and is likely to take some time to accomplish. Not only is there a lack of consensus on the best way to model AI-based labor changes, but more important, there is no consensus as to the best policy path to help us prepare for these changes.
  * [Mandating AI Fairness May Come At The Expense Of Other Types of Fairness][14] – In 2016, ProPublica sparked a conversation over the use of risk assessment algorithms when they concluded that a widely used “score proved remarkably unreliable in forecasting violent crime” in Florida. Their examination of the racial disparities in scoring has been cited countless times, often as a proxy for the power of automation and algorithms in daily life. As this examination continues, two precepts are worth keeping in mind. First, the social significance of algorithms needs to be considered, not just their internal model significance. While the accuracy of algorithms are important, more emphasis should be placed on how they are used within institutional settings. And second, fairness is not a single idea. Mandates for certain kinds of fairness could come at the expense of others forms of fairness. As always, policymakers need to be cognizant of the tradeoffs.
