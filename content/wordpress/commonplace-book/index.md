Commonplace books (or commonplaces) were a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. Such books were essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind. This is my commonplace book. It is a mess.

**Philosophy**

  * Exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when, or before, we say anything at all &#8211; whereas information is the measurable, demonstrable utterance we actually come out with.
  * The mind/body problem explained –<http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/mind.htm>
  * Thomas Reid &#8211;<http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reid/>
  * A fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true of the _whole_ from the fact that it is true of some _part_ of the whole (or even of _every_[proper part][1]). For example: &#8220;This fragment of metal cannot be broken with a hammer, therefore the machine of which it is a part cannot be broken with a hammer.&#8221; This is clearly fallacious, because many machines can be broken into their constituent parts without any of those parts being breakable. This is also known as a problem of induction
  * The Intelligent Design Fallacy – From Tim Lee, people assume that there needs to be some kind of designer, when in fact none is needed, i.e., linux works well without an agent directing its course.

  * Apophenia is the experience of seeing meaningful patterns or connections in random or meaningless data. The term was coined in 1958 by Klaus Conrad, who defined it as the &#8220;unmotivated seeing of connections&#8221; accompanied by a &#8220;specific experience of an abnormal meaningfulness&#8221;.

  * Introduction to major philosophical thinkers –[http://www.btinternet.com/~glynhughes/squashed/][3]
  * Perhaps the most committed philosopher of suicide was a 19th-century German who called himself Philipp Mainländer. He argued in his _Philosophy of Redemption_ that everything extant yearns for nonexistence and that human beings are the shards of a God who, to overcome the monotonous agony of immortality, created a finite universe so He, too, could pass into oblivion. &#8220;Our world,&#8221; Mainländer wrote, &#8220;is the means and the only means of achieving nonexistence.&#8221; On April 1, 1875, Mainländer hanged himself in his home. He used a stack of copies of _Philosophy of Redemption_, which had arrived the previous day, as a pedestal. He was 34 years old.
  * Noesis means understanding, as the ability to sense, or know something, immediately.
  * Proprioception from Latin _proprius_, meaning &#8220;one&#8217;s own&#8221; and perception, is the sense of the relative position of neighbouring parts of the body. Unlike the exteroceptive senses, by which we perceive the outside world, and interoceptive senses, by which we perceive the pain and movement of internal organs, proprioception is a third distinct sensory modality that provides feedback solely on the status of the body internally. It is the sense that indicates whether the body is moving with the required effort, as well as where the various parts of the body are located in relation to each other.

  *  VICE: Hi Massimo. What do you think of theories like Terrile&#8217;s?Massimo Pigliucci: I’m not directly familiar with Terrile’s work, in particular, but that’s an old idea, which has been proposed by philosophers in many guises. In general philosophy, it&#8217;s known as “idealism,” meaning the concept of what we call reality is the manifestation of a mind, i.e., it’s an idea. George Berkeley—the namesake for the Californian university—was a proponent of idealism. Although he thought that the mind in question was that of God, not of a computer.I actually think the argument is interesting, philosophically speaking, but it has two problems: it is entirely empirically untestable—i.e., it’s not science—and is based on what I think is a fundamental flaw. The philosopher Nick Bostrom argued something along the lines of what Terrile is proposing quite recently.
  * Supposedly a favorite of John F. Kennedy, the fallacy of Chesteron’s fence is as follows:  
    <blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
      <p>
        In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    Put simply, don’t ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up.</li> </ul>

      * In the West, knowledge begins as a winnowing process. It goes back to ancient Greece, where the rich, free menfolk were debating politics and steering the state. Many opinions were expressed, but only some of them were true, so knowledge became the winnowing of those opinions defined to be rare gems of truth. That idea — that knowledge is what makes it through a winnowing process — not by coincidence fits perfectly with the paper medium that we used for it. Paper is expensive, libraries are small, very few people can get published. So we’ve thought of knowledge as that which makes it through a very small aperture.

      * Reed&#8217;s law is the assertion of [David P. Reed][11] that the [utility][12] of large [networks][13], particularly [social networks][14], can [scale exponentially][15] with the size of the network. The reason for this is that the number of possible sub-groups of network participants is 2N − N − 1, where N is the number of participants. This grows much more rapidly than either 
          * the number of participants, N, or
          * the number of possible pair connections, N(N − 1)/2 (which follows [Metcalfe&#8217;s law][16]).
        
        so that even if the utility of groups available to be joined is very small on a peer-group basis, eventually the [network effect][17] of potential group membership can dominate the overall economics of the system.</li> </ul> 
        
        **Economics / Finance**
        
          * The Multiple Specificity of Capital &#8211; Each capital good is, at every moment, devoted to what in the circumstances appears to its owner to be its ‘best’, i.e. its most profitable use. The word ‘best’ indicates a position on a scale of alternative possibilities. Changing circumstances will change that position. Unexpected change may open up new possibilities of use, and make possible a switch from yesterday&#8217;s ‘best’ to an even better use. Or, it may compel a switch from ‘present best’ to ‘second best’ use. Hence, we cannot be surprised to find that at each moment some durable capital goods are not being used for the purposes for which they were originally designed. These new uses may, from the point of view of the owners of the capital goods, be ‘better’ or ‘worse’, more or less profitable than the original ones. In each case the change in use means that the original plan in which the capital good was meant to play its part has gone astray. In most of the arguments about capital encountered today these facts and their implications, many of them crucial to a clear understanding of the nature of economic progress, are almost completely ignored.
          * Sloppy language leads to sloppy thinking. By continuing to use the 19th-century term capitalism for an economic system that has evolved into something altogether different, we are liable to misunderstand the sources of strength of the market economy and the role capital plays within it:  <http://www.johnkay.com/2012/01/11/let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-the-market-economy>

          * Of course, a well-confirmed proposition in economics known as Say’s Law tells us that in a regime of freely moving prices and capital, long-run overproduction is exceedingly improbable, if not literally impossible.
          * Robert Chapman-Smith: This is a perfect example of academic over-think. If your argument rests on the idea that the abundance of choice can itself be tyrannical, then you seriously need to a better job of crafting objections to your own argument. Yes, choices bear transaction costs, but the solution to this problem isn&#8217;t to remove choices, but rather to diminish or remove the transaction costs through innovation.

        **Words and Phrases**
        
          * &#8220;Tu ne cede malis&#8221; means &#8220;do not give in to evil,&#8221; but it is commonly used in &#8220;Tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito&#8221; meaning &#8220;do not give in to evil but proceed ever more boldly against it.&#8221;
          * amor patriae &#8211; love for ones country
          * Hic Terminus Haeret &#8211; Here is the end of all things
          * _Essentia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem_; i.e., the number of axioms or assumptions required to establish a truth or explain a phenomenon should be kept to the minimum possible.
          * Wille zum Leben &#8211; will to live (wil-lay zum lay-ben).
          * Isonomia &#8211; equality of political rights (from the Greek ἴσος isos, &#8220;equal,&#8221; and νόμος nomos, &#8220;usage, custom, law) was a word used by Ancient Greek writers such as Herodotus[3] and Thucydides[4] to refer to some kind of popular government. It was subsequently eclipsed until brought back into English as isonomy (&#8220;equality of law&#8221;).
          * The law targets obscenity, but only its physical forms, which makes it easier to enforce. When little Johnny steps inside the adult video store, clerks can check his ID before selling him that DVD of _industrial sexuality._
          * _Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia – many will pass through and knowledge will be increased_
          * Demesne &#8211; The land around a lords manner that is strictly under his control as compared the fields that were to be harvested
          * Praestationsfaehigkeit
          * Vaginae gentium &#8211; the cradle of humanity, quite literally the womb of humanity
          * Justitia fundamentum regnorum &#8211; justice is fundamental to reign
          * Pari passu &#8211; of equal step
          * _Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam  
_ _Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa  
_ &#8220;Had God designed the world, it would not be  
            A world so frail and faulty as we see.&#8221;
          * Sehnsucht – (Zeen-Zucht) &#8211; Lewis described Sehnsucht as the &#8220;inconsolable longing&#8221; in the human heart for &#8220;we know not what.&#8221; In the afterword to the third edition of The Pilgrim&#8217;s Regress he provided examples of what sparked this desire in him particularly:  
            That unnameable something, desire for which pierces us like a rapier at the smell of bonfire, the sound of wild ducks flying overhead, the title of The Well at the World&#8217;s End, the opening lines of &#8220;Kubla Khan&#8221;, the morning cobwebs in late summer, or the noise of falling waves.[[3]  
][19] It is sometimes felt as a longing for a far off country, but not a particular earthly land which we can identify. Furthermore there is something in the experience which suggests this far off country is very familiar and indicative of what we might otherwise call &#8220;home&#8221;. In this sense it is a type of nostalgia, in the original sense of that word. At other times it may seem as a longing for a someone or even a something. But the majority of people who experience it are not conscious of what or who the longed for object may be. Indeed, the longing is of such profundity and intensity that the subject may immediately be only aware of the emotion itself and not cognizant that there is a something longed for.
          * Weltschmerz (from the German, meaning world-pain or world-weariness) is a term coined by the German author Jean Paul and denotes the kind of feeling experienced by someone who understands that physical reality can never satisfy the demands of the mind. This kind of pessimistic world view was widespread among several romantic authors such as Lord Byron, Giacomo Leopardi, François-René de Chateaubriand, Alfred de Musset, Nikolaus Lenau, Herman Hesse, and Heinrich Heine. It is also used to denote the feeling of sadness when thinking about the evils of the world—compare empathy, theodicy.
          * Mono no aware also translated as &#8220;an empathy toward things,&#8221; or &#8220;a sensitivity of ephemera,&#8221; is a Japanese term used to describe the awareness of mujo or the transience of things and a bittersweet sadness at their passing.
          * Lacrimae rerum  is the Latin for &#8220;tears of things,&#8221;  The term comes from line 462 of Book I of The Aeneid, an epic poem written in Latin by Virgil, one of Rome&#8217;s most distinguished poets, in the first century BC. Aeneas, while crying, says, &#8220;sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt&#8221; as he gazes at one of the murals found in a Carthaginian temple, which depicts battles of the Trojan War and deaths of his friends and countrymen. Translated this says, &#8220;These are tears for events and mortal things (sufferings) touch the soul.&#8221; As he stands there, Aeneas is overcome by the futility of warfare and waste of human life. The burden man has to bear, ever present frailty and suffering, is what would define the essence of human experience.  A translation by the famous classicist Robert Fagles renders the quote as: &#8220;The world is a world of tears, and the burdens of mortality touch the heart.&#8221;

          * Social distance describes the [distance][44] between different groups of [society][45] and is opposed to _locational distance_. The notion includes all differences such as [social class][46], [race][47]/[ethnicity][48] or [sexuality][49], but also the fact that the different groups do not mix. The term is often applied in [cities][50], but its use is not limited to that. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distance>

          * An aphorism, properly stamped and molded, has not been &#8220;deciphered&#8221; when it has simply been read; rather one has then to begin its interpretation, for which is required an art of interpretation. Neitszche
          * &#8220;Fusion of horizons&#8221; is a [dialectical][51] concept which results from the rejection of two alternatives: [objectivism][52], whereby the objectification of the other is premised on the forgetting of oneself; and[absolute knowledge][53], according to which[universal history][54] can be articulated within a single[horizon][55]. Therefore, it argues that we exist neither in closed horizons, nor within a horizon that is unique.
          * People come from different backgrounds and it is not possible to totally remove oneself from one&#8217;s background, history, culture, gender, language, education, etc. to an entirely different system of attitudes, beliefs and ways of thinking.[[1]][56] People may be looking for a way to be engaged in understanding a conversation or dialogue about different cultures and the speaker interprets texts or stories based on his or her past experience and prejudice. Therefore, “[hermeneutic][57] reflection and determination of one’s own present life interpretation calls for the unfolding of one’s ‘effective-historical’ consciousness.”[[2]][58] During the discourse, a fusion of “horizons” takes place between the speaker and listeners.
          * [Gadamer][59][[3]][60] defines horizon:  
            Every finite presentation has its limitations. We define the concept of “situation” by saying that it represents a standpoint that limits the possibility of vision. Hence an essential part of the concept of situation is the concept of “Horizon.” The horizon is the range of vision that includes everything that can be seen from a particular vantage point…. A person who has no horizon is a man who does not see far enough and hence overvalues what is nearest to him. Contrariwise, to have an horizon means not to be limited to what is nearest, but to be able to see beyond it…. The working out of the hermeneutical situation means the achievement of the right horizon of enquiry for the questions evoked by the encounter with tradition.  
            Person A and person B exchange their ideas and opinions within a conversation. People come from different places have different opinions and this difference in background creates a set of [prejudice][61] and [bias][62] which provides various intrinsic values and meanings while the conversation is carrying on. By receiving the information from person A, a fusion of person B’s vision limitation are taking place and consequently, it broadens person B’s range of horizon. In other words, the totality of all that can be realized or thought about by a person at a given time in history and in a particular culture widens and enriches. Gadamer argues that people have a “historically effected consciousness” (wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein) and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. Thus, interpreting a text involves a &#8216;fusion of horizons&#8217; where the scholar finds the way to articulate the text&#8217;s history with their own background.

        **Arguments against a gold standard**
        
        The most fundamental argument against a gold standard is that when the relative price of gold is go up, that creates deflationary pressures on the general price level, thereby harming output and employment.  There is also the potential for radically high inflation through gold, though today that seems like less a problem than it was in the seventeenth century.
        
        Why put your economy at the mercy of these essentially random forces?  I believe the 19th century was a relatively good time to have had a gold standard, but the last twenty years, with their rising commodity prices, would have been an especially bad time.  When it comes to the next twenty years, who knows?
        
        Whether or not there is “enough gold,” and there always will be at some price, the transition to a gold standard still involves the likelihood of major price level shocks, if only because the transition itself involves a repricing of gold.  A gold standard, by the way, is still compatible with plenty of state intervention.

        The laws of thought are fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discourse itself is based. The rules have a long tradition in the history of philosophy. They are laws that guides and underline everyone&#8217;s thinking, thoughts, expressions, discussions, etc.
        
        The three classic laws of thought are attributed to Aristotle and were foundational in scholastic logic. They are: law of identity, the law of noncontradiction, and the law of excluded middle
        
        1. The law of identity. The law of identity states that an object is the same as itself: A ≡ A. For the law of identity, Aristotle,[1] wrote:
        
        Now &#8220;why a thing is itself&#8221; is a meaningless inquiry (for—to give meaning to the question &#8216;why&#8217;—the fact or the existence of the thing must already be evident—e.g., that the moon is eclipsed—but the fact that a thing is itself is the single reason and the single cause to be given in answer to all such questions as why the man is man, or the musician musical, unless one were to answer, &#8216;because each thing is inseparable from itself, and its being one just meant this.&#8217; This, however, is common to all things and is a short and easy way with the question.) &#8211; Metaphysics, Book VII, Part 17
        
        2. The law of non-contradiction. In logic, the law of non-contradiction &#8230; states, in the words of Aristotle, that  &#8220;one cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time&#8221;.
        
        3. The law of the excluded middle. Aristotle wrote that ambiguity can arise from the use of ambiguous names, but cannot exist in the &#8220;facts&#8221; themselves:
        
        It is impossible, then, that &#8216;being a man&#8217; should mean precisely &#8216;not being a man&#8217;, if &#8216;man&#8217; not only signifies something about one subject but also has one significance. … And it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing, except in virtue of an ambiguity, just as if one whom we call &#8216;man&#8217;, and others were to call &#8216;not-man&#8217;; but the point in question is not this, whether the same thing can at the same time be and not be a man in name, but whether it can be in fact.
        
        &nbsp;
        
        &nbsp;
        
        The term concettismo derives from concetto (from the Latin concipere, ‘to conceive’), which had been used since Petrarch to denote the idea behind a work of art.
        
        The theory of the concetto thus promised to resolve the conflicting claims of ornament and edification, which was also increasingly a conflict between individuality of expression and adherence to the cultural norms of the day.
        
        In the Renaissance, the term (which is related to the word concept) indicated any particularly fanciful expression of wit, and was later used pejoratively of outlandish poetic metaphors.
        
        For example human experiences are described in terms of an outsized metaphor (a kind of metaphorical hyperbole), like the stock comparison of eyes to the sun, which Shakespeare makes light of in his sonnet 130: &#8220;My mistress&#8217; eyes are nothing like the sun.&#8221;
        
        &nbsp;
        
        The term Caledonian Antisyzygy refers to the &#8220;idea of dueling polarities within one entity&#8221;,[[1]][68] thought of as typical for the Scottish psyche and literature. It was first coined by [G. Gregory Smith][69] in his 1919 book _Scottish Literature: Character and Influence_[[2]][70] in which he wrote:
        
        Does Facebook have sufficient market power to profitably reduce market output and increase market prices?
        
        With two sided markets, this is complicated. How might market power on one side affect the behaviors on the other?
        
        Durable market power is predicate to antitrust violation of the Sherman Act

        The conquerors are held to be the sons old gods. This in many cases they are since these gods are nothing but the souls of their ancestors raised to godhead by apotheosis. (Oppenheimer, The State, pg. 35)
        
        The problem with Marxist theories of class conflict is that they naturalize a certain class&#8230; They make the priorities of one class primary, subordinating what could be a legitimate form of livelihood/ business. We should not be so quick to proclaim that the interests of the bourgeoisie are not valid, that their
        
        Conflict theory a la Oppenheimer is very congruent with Dierdre&#8217;s theory. Both propose that a shift in the assumptions of the social relations is needed to change the state. I think there is something very powerful about her argument in this regard.

Or that any restriction that is built in to the structure of a government is a good thing. Or that any negative right should be maximized. I would think that criticisms of the balanced budget would work well here to counter these claims I&#8217;m making.
