M-boneÂ (short for &#8220;multicast backbone&#8221;) was an experimental backbone for carrying IP multicast traffic on the Internet. It was developed in the early 1990s and required specialized hardware and software.[1] Since the operators of most Internet routers have disabled IP multicast due to concerns regarding bandwidth tracking and billing, the Mbone was created in order to connect multicast-capable networks over the existing Internet infrastructure.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Because the M-bone has been in use only since 1992, and because using the M-bone requires special hardware and software, so far only 1,500 of the estimated 70,000 networks that make up the Internet have been set up as M-bone hubs. As a result, it remains to be seen whether the M-bone will evolve into an Internet-based network connecting every business and home, or whether it is merely a limited prototype for the &#8220;information highway&#8221; that is supposed to be built eventually by telephone and cable TV companies to carry interactive audio, video and text services.
