A simple question desires a simple answer. 

The overturning of political relations of authority is the essence of a revolution. In the French case, a certain idealistic zeal led to more, a bloodletting and then an overturning of the social relations. Regardless, any revolution because it changes relations of authority and power are by their very definition _not_ conservative.
