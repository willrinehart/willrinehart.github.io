Regardless of your view, morality is about judgement. Ethics addresses the rules by which these judgements are made. From  Aesthetics and judgement

[Conjecture][1]: we expect moral judgement to have behavioural implications, whereas aesthetic judgement does not

Both are still part of a larger class of value judgement

The object of inquiry for moral and aesthetics is separate, but it is unclear whether the decision making process that goes on in our complex ticker is different. The sphere of implication is clearly different and the properties we ascribe to those are clearly of a different sort.

Conjecture: We can contrast aesthetic value with moral value, as the former is grounded in aesthetic qualities such as serenity and gracefulness and the latter is grounded in moral qualities such as cruelty or justice

From [here][2]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  This immediately suggests a promising way of distinguishing the two kinds of value, in terms of the presence of two distinctive sets of  properties: rightness, wrongness, courage, justice and the rest on the one hand, and beauty,ugliness, delicacy and so on; goodness and badness, equally attributable in both domains,would on this view serve as placeholders indicating the presence of positive and negativevalue of either kind (or of another kind altogether).
