Grover Norquist went to burning man this year to the chagrin of some and the delight of others. In a [writeup at Reuters][1], he found himself at odds to describe the event, mulling over the question, &#8220;What is Burning Man?&#8221; Although the words to understand the event failed him, his assessment was glowing:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Burning Man is greater than I had ever imagined. I have been to large demonstrations in favor of the environment, and the trash left behind is knee-deep. At Burning Man, you are hard-pressed to find a cigarette butt on the ground. There are no trash bins. Participants carry it in, and they carry it out. I have been to the Louvre. It is a very big place with many nice paintings. I knew that. I was not disappointed. Burning Man is more like Petra, the lost city in Jordan, which I found more impressive than its advance billing or reputation.

Burning Man feels to be a world apart, but is is really a world in parallel.

This is not Camus&#8217; Theater of the Absurb where life is devoid of meaning and.

Nor is this the fashioning of some great order and abrogation of commercial life. It is an exploration

&nbsp;

Why did Grover like it? It is Burkean

&nbsp;

The norms of life off the Plata echo the

  * radical inclusion
  * gifting
  * decommodification
  * radical self-reliance
  * radical self-expression
  * communal effort
  * civic responsibility
  * leaving no trace
  * participation
  * immediacy.

&nbsp;

all of the normalÂ a Temporary Autonomous Zones, spaces of exploration.

  revolution has never yet resulted in achieving this dream. The vision comes to life in the moment of uprising&#8211;but as soon as &#8220;the Revolution&#8221; triumphs and the State returns, the dream and the ideal are already betrayed.
