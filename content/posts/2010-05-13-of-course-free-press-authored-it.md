From the, &#8220;[Yes, of course we all knew this][1]&#8221; file,

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  A letter that Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., is circulating on Capitol Hill expressing gushing support for FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski&#8217;s controversial proposal to subject broadband to tougher regulation wasn&#8217;t written by the congressman.

  How do we know? Digital fingerprints left by the author, Ben Scott, policy director of Free Press, a media watchdog.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  It&#8217;s common knowledge that advocacy groups and corporations routinely craft letters and even legislation for lawmakers. But it&#8217;s not every day they leave behind a trail of evidence confirming the link. Such is the case with Scott, who forgot to scrub the so-called &#8220;metadata&#8221; &#8212; yeah, I&#8217;d never heard of this either &#8212; listing him as the author of the correspondence making the rounds on the Hill.
</p>

I think its great that an organization helping to solve the Internet&#8217;s problems cannot even delete the metadata. Really?
