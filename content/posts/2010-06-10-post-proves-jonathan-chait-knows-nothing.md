I think this post is really telling. The takeaway line:

> If you look at the questions, though, they turn out not to gauge so much economic knowledge as agreement with the neoclassical economic model. Klein lists his questions:
> 
> 1) Mandatory licensing of professional services increases the prices of those services (unenlightened answer: disagree). 2) Overall, the standard of living is higher today than it was 30 years ago (unenlightened answer: disagree). 3) Rent control leads to housing shortages (unenlightened answer: disagree). 4) A company with the largest market share is a monopoly (unenlightened answer: agree). 5) Third World workers working for American companies overseas are being exploited (unenlightened answer: agree). 6) Free trade leads to unemployment (unenlightened answer: agree). 7) Minimum wage laws raise unemployment (unenlightened answer: disagree)

And then he goes on to say:

> Conservatism and libertarianism believe that the neoclassical model of self-correcting markets and perfectly rational behavior perfectly, or almost perfectly, whereas liberals tend to believe that the model falls short in all sorts of ways. (See: Economic Collapse, 2007.)

The problems with this abound. Unlike Chait, I am not a party hack, so I do understand his complete towing of party lines. And of course the model fails. No serious thinker would say otherwise. Furthermore, conflating libertarianism with neoclassical, when many are Austrian or New Institutionalists is just foolish.

To respond to some of those questions:  
-Try to get a rent controlled apartment in New York.  
-A monopoly is an economic term, not a colloquial one.  
-Third world workers are not exploited, their wages are upward bound by productivity  
-Finally, we have the Droid and iPads now, to say that the standard of living hasn&#8217;t risen is to say that you haven&#8217;t been paying attention
