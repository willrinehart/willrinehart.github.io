> Guilt versus innocence? What weight do they carry when placed opposite the prison construction lobby and the police and &#8220;corrections&#8221; unions, who stand ready to weigh in with money and endorsements for any politician whose line is &#8220;more arrests, more convictions, more jails&#8221; &#8230; or to come down like a ton of bricks on any candidate who suggests, however mildly, that more than two million prisoners and nearly one in every thirty Americans under &#8220;correctional supervision&#8221; may be overdoing it just a tad?
