I once heard someone say that the prison industrial complex was a product of free markets. It is a comment that is sadly indicative of the state of affairs of political economy.

Even though I believe in the concept, I am very hesitant to use the term because it assumes a set of priors many do not have. Free markets, like capitalist, is a poorly understood term. When economists talk of free markets they mean, generally, markets free of government regulation, but even this is a misnomer because all markets are at their core heavily regulated. And deregulation, while it did get rid of overt price controls, clearly did not rid us of laws. Most of what the deregulation movement aimed at achieving was getting rid of the most egregious of these laws, but regulation of factories, of the Internet, of a whole set of industries did not wane.

Digression: For those who harp on large corporations, it would be worth it to point out that regulations add a fixed cost that prices smaller companies out, thus making larger firms more common. For a great example of this, look at Sarbox.

Regardless, the prison industrial complex is the exact opposite of the free market. It is the public-private cabal that Oppenheimer warned us about: Der Staat. The State. It is what happens when the government actions create thriving industry. And it is thriving.

For a flavor of things, take in this graph. Take it all in:

What has happened is remarkable. A huge increase of inmates.

One could say that it the result of the abrogation of rules. But we know that violent crime has been dropping for a number of years. We are in fact the most

Scholars will often talk about rules in three kinds of dichotomies.

  * Elaborated versus restricted codes
  * Individualistic versus collectivistic
  * Low context versus high context

Those on the right tend to go with each other.

It is not surprise then that America is the most litigated society. Moral

The two types of language codes are the elaborated code and the restricted code. The restricted code is suitable for insiders who share assumptions and understanding on the topic, whereas the elaborated code does not assume that the listener shares these assumptions or understandings, and thus elaborated code is more explicit, more thorough, and does not require the listener to read between the lines.
