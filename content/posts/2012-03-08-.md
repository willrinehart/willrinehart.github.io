<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone" title="Name These Brands" src="http://www.adbusters.org/files/imagecache/item-image-full/images/adbusters_84_name-these.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="368" />

This image has been floating around the net for a while and when I saw it recently I was amused. It comes from AdBusters—a magazine I have been getting for a number of years. The lack of technical rigor of their rants on economics is worth the subscription alone.

As they profess, &#8220;We are a global network of culture jammers and creatives working to change the way information flows, the way corporations wield power, and the way meaning is produced in our society.&#8221; The original culture jammers were Situationalists, who employed a technique called [detournement][1], subversive political pranks which turned &#8220;expressions of the capitalist system against itself.&#8221;

As they see it, it is a problem that we live in an environment of brands, lamenting the loss of the innocence of the forest, but, I, for one, am glad. Why should we learn about the various types of leafs? There is no use in knowing which one is a pine or oak, unless you are an arborist, and this is the very basis of knowledge. Knowledge is useful. Perhaps it was meant to turn the capitalism system
