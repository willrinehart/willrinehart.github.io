Tim Wu,

> Markets are born free, yet no sooner are they born than some would-be emperor is forging chains.  Paradoxically, it sometimes happens that the only way to preserve freedom is through judicious controls on the exercise of private power.  If we believe in liberty, it must be freedom from both private and public coercion.

To begin, the market is not a thing, so they are not born, per se. The market is a process of discovery via a certain kind of human relationship, one kind of discovery among many, I might add. The market expands as people forge new kinds of relationships, but for brevity, we use the singular to take the place of the multiplicity, and in doing so simplifying an extremely complex idea.

Wu is obviously channeling Rousseau&#8211;&#8220;Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains.&#8221; It was a god awful statement back in the 1700s and it is completely myopic to repeat now. [Wo]man is not born free. We are born poor and naked into this world and socialized into it. The same is true for markets. The market is not a thing separate from our relationships because the market is just one kind of relationship. As one kind of human relationship, the market is created among individuals and guided by norms, laws and appropriate rules of behavior. Perhaps Wu desires a more loose denotation with free, but the connotation that markets, when forged, are without is without merit.

As Pete Beottke often repeats, it is because of this feature that we can have governance without government. Governance can be persuasive without being coercive. Think about language. Everyone seems to speak common language for some unknown reason. Smith called this appropriability ie what is appropriate for a given situation. Freedom is not freedom from the influence of society but from the coercive actions that may be applied to an individual. For many of the original liberal thinkers, this was the main reason behind

Wu confuses persuasion from coercion, and being that he is not a rhetorical scholar, it is an mistake I am willing to forgive. There is only one force that has coercive power and that is the government. Only the government can force you to do something. Everyone and everything else has persuasive power. Society, for example, has massively persuasive power. It persuades you to speak a certain way and act a certain way, but I doubt  (language) and act a certain way (
