[From Findlaw][1]:

> It is important to note the difference between &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and &#8220;civil liberties.&#8221; The legal area known as &#8220;civil rights&#8221; has traditionally revolved around the basic right to be free from unequal treatment based on certain protected characteristics (race, gender, disability, etc.) in settings such as employment and housing. &#8220;Civil liberties&#8221; concern basic rights and freedoms that are guaranteed &#8212; either explicitly identified in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, or interpreted through the years by courts and lawmakers. Civil liberties include:
> 
> Freedom of speech  
> The right to privacy  
> The right to be free from unreasonable searches of your home  
> The right to a fair court trial  
> The right to marry  
> The right to vote

This definition, if it is standard for lawyers, confuses the traiditonal notions of rights and liberties. Three male felons do not each have the right to marry or to vote.

Some thoughts on rights versus liberties:

  * Rights can be abrogated in practice by the State; but to abrogate liberties is impossible, because liberties what we call rights when they are actually administered.
  * The Bill of Rights is really just the Bill of Liberties. There have been a number of times when we have abrogated &#8220;rights&#8221; for certain beneficial social outcomes. For example libel is still illegal. If you truly had a right to free speech then this just simply would not exist.
  * Rights achieve their _Raison d&#8217;état_ and their _pouvoir_ for classical liberals because there is something above, some truth above the government that makes it subservient. There is to purposefully use a loaded word _logos_. This can come from believing in rights as a ethical (in the Greek communal sense) imperative or by believing in a higher power that orders the world under some natural law principle. I do not subscribe to either of these views.
  * _Logos_ means a number of things including the account, the truth or the argument.
  * Aristotle applied the term _logos_ to refer to &#8220;reasoned discourse&#8221; or &#8220;the argument&#8221; in the field of rhetoric. The Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe. After Judaism came under Hellenistic influence, Philo (ca. 20 BC–AD 50) adopted the term into Jewish philosophy. The Gospel of John identifies the _Logos_, through which all things are made, as divine (theos), and further identifies Jesus as the incarnation of the _Logos_.
  * Remember, the Bible is commonly known as the Word_,_ and because there is no-thing but the Bible as an account, it has to be _the account_. Please note that most of the learned people of the classical age would know Greek.

  * Lawyers are not philosophers, they are just extremely skilled (and rule driven) administrators. They are helping to administer justice, as are judges.
  * The best lawyers are actually philosophers.
  * Other countries give us a sense of how the Rule of Law is applied, which we can then compare against.
  * [From Schumpeter][2]: Mr Coase&#8217;s theory continues to explain some of the most puzzling problems in modern business. Take the rise of vast and highly diversified business groups in the emerging world, such as India&#8217;s Tata group and Turkey&#8217;s Koc Holding. Many Western observers dismiss these as relics of a primitive form of capitalism. But they make perfect sense when you consider the transaction costs of going to the market. Where trust in established institutions is scarce, it makes sense for companies to stretch their brands over many industries. And where capital and labour markets are inefficient, it makes equal sense for companies to allocate their own capital and train their own loyalists.
  * From the quote above, we can read trust as being the rule of law and transactions costs as being partly due to administrative inefficiencies.

  * So what is the Rule of Law? One might say that it is the equal application of a rule. But even within this very loose definition of the concept, we know in tax codes that there is clearly not an equal application of a rule. For example, the Affordable Care Act will not apply to firms smaller than 50 people. This should have the tendency to depress the stock of firms larger than 50 up till the point where the cost of compliance is marginally deferent to a firm. This however will be different for each industry given their profit margin, etc. Regime uncertainty is a kind of Rule of Law cost.
