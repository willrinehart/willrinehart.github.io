Gordon Crovitz has been getting some heat over [his article][1] shattering the &#8220;urban legend&#8221; that the Internet is an example of the role of government in innovation. [Vint Cerf][2], [Michael Hiltzik][3], and a [number][4] [of][5] [reporters][6] have written in opposition to Crovitz&#8217;s thesis, but sadly many of the more interesting questions have been dealt with in a comprehensive manner.

What, for example, constitutes invention? A foolish semantic quibble perhaps, but it makes or breaks the arguments. Economic historians and scholars of entreprenueruship tend to describe the large scale adoption of a technology as innovation, whereas invention describes the moment of genesis. Asking a simple question, like who created the Internet, without a clear explanation of terms has yielded a similarly simple discussion. For example, if we define the Internet as a global and large scale interconnected network of networks, then our government clearly didn&#8217;t create the Internet merely because of the global requirement.

Where Crovitz is a little clumsy about his framing, my colleague Berin Szoka is not,

> While historians quibble over the Internet&#8217;s birth date, one date stands out as the day the Internet ceased being a niche for a limited number of universities, governments and military organizations, and began its transformation into a medium that would connect billions: On March 15, 1985, Symbolics, a Massachusetts computer company, registered symbolics.com, the Internet&#8217;s first commercial domain name.

The government did help facilitate the creation of standards, but all of the important things on the Internet, all of the innovative services, all of the content and all of the social connection, have been created by non-governmental interests.

This isn&#8217;t a moot discussion, it is an undergirding argument for Internet regulation. If the Internet was invented by the government, then there is not much overreach for that institution to extend its power over the space with new regulations. However, if Internet has extended over the reaches of the planet because of the private sector, then the basis of regulation is much more shaky.

Another interesting tangent: could the private sector have created the Internet without the help of the government? To co-opt the phrase of Peter Boetkke, &#8220;governance does not equal government.&#8221; I do not want to commit the fallacy of

  There are a number of statement thats are true but not obvious that do disturb the normal narrative of the creation of the Internet:

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We know that there was never a single grant provided by the government with the intent on creating the Internet.
    </li>
    <li>
      It was created through an ad-hoc process that in many ways is descriptive of the distributed nature of the medium.
