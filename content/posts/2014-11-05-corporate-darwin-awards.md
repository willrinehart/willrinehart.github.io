Sadly, Armen Alchian&#8217;s key insights into competition fail to be understood by large portions of the profession. His thinking was evolutionary to its core and simple. Successful firms are not consciously maximizing their profits but seem to do so because the market culls those that fail to yield positive returns. So, it was with some glee that I saw [this Reddit][1] on the Corporate Darwin Awards. Here are some of my favorite examples from the discussion with their explanations:

[Prodigy][2]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Prodigy online service. They had a great message board system, which was included in the monthly rate. They got greedy, and for no reason other than wanting to make more money, started charging people to use the board, per message. Beyond idiotic, and at the time, so many of us users were like, ok, we&#8217;re done with Prodigy then. Within one year, they lost almost complete market share to Compuserve and AOL, and were all but non-existent shortly thereafter. All because they got extra greedy

[The Sprint Nextel merger][3]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #000000;">Sprint merging with Nextel. Sprint phones couldn&#8217;t work on the Nextel network and vice versa. Sprint ended up losing $30 billion over the course of the next 3-5 years. The stock price has yet to get close to the initial price before the merger.</span>
</p>

[The Milwaukee Road][4]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #000000;">The Milwaukee Road is one of my favorites. They abandoned half of their main line because they thought it was losing money despite having heavy traffic. Several years after they had torn up the line they realized there had been an accounting error, and that was actually the only part of the system that was making money. They sold off some of their rolling stock to generate some short term cash and then leased it back. When the lease price increased they could not afford to repair their own equipment, so they sold off more to the leasers. Rinse, repeat. Instead of completing their electrification and buying new electric locomotives (which GE was willing to give them a deal on) they decided to remove the electrification and sell it for scrap. When they did this scrap prices fell and it ended up being more expensive to dieselize than it would have been to finish their electrification. Needless to say, things did not go well for them.</span>

[Digg][5]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Originally, digg was basically a news/entertainment site where the top stories were voted up by users (similar to reddit). They changed it round so that there was a much heavier emphasis on connecting to people and organisations, so you had your own personal front page influenced by which people you followed (a bit more like Twitter). People were already annoyed by the influence of the most heavy users at the time, and the change made it way worse. It was like they took one thing about the site that annoyed people and made it the main feature. &#8230; <span style="color: #000000;">It should be pointed out that Digg was massively more popular than Reddit at the beginning. Reddit started eating into their market share before the site change, but when it happened it was a dramatic switch and Reddit became the more popular site almost instantaneously.</span>

  The &#8220;product&#8221; was never intended to reach customers. The idea was, they&#8217;d box up bricks, sell the &#8220;hard drives&#8221; to retail businesses for resale to consumers, and take the cash advance to actually make the real hard drives while the fake ones were stuck in warehouses while waiting out customs. While the real ones were being manufactured, they would issue a recall that would get the &#8220;defective units&#8221; sent back to the manufacturer before they even left the holding warehouses and swap them back out with the real thing with none the wiser. They shot themselves in the foot beyond the harebrained &#8220;brick in a box&#8221; scheme by laying off some of the workers who went and actually put the bricks in boxes. Being pissed off that they had been laid off right around the holidays, they leaked what the company had done in retaliation.

  Iomega might not be the worst, but it certainly gave it the ol&#8217; college try. I worked for Iomega at the height of the Zip era (&#8217;97-&#8217;98) as an engineer, and in addition to my regular duties, I was fortunate enough to get to participate in a so-called SkunkWorks group run by a scary-smart guy named Dave that Iomega basically paid to not work at other companies. The main idea behind this group was that, contrary to the marketing-think of the time, the consumer base for commoditized tech products always looked to early adopters, and the early adopters were generally engineers. In effect, if we could come up with products that we wanted, we thought they might be something work making and selling. Not everyone will agree with this philosophy, but I&#8217;ll let you make the call after I make my case. We generally set about to think of products that could have a Zip (or the horrifyingly-named Clik later renamed MiniZip) drive in it, but not exclusively so. Here are the three ideas we pitched to marketing: Digital cameras. The Sony Mavica was the ruling consumer digital camera at the time, and it used a regular old 1.44MB floppy disk as its storage medium. We proposed a digital camera with a Zip drive in it &#8212; 100MB instead of 1.44MB. The possibility of higher resolution images, sound memos to go along with the images, or even full-motion video was something we wanted, and a Zip disk was the medium du jour for large portable storage. Marketing declined, because we were in the drive business, and they&#8217;d rather sell the drives to people in the camera business; besides, digital cameras were a fad, and they would never replace regular film cameras. Digital music players. We each had our own MP3 players, and none of us were happy with them. Improved feature sets and a Zip drive as removable storage medium seemed like something that could seriously boost Zip disk sales. Marketing declined again, because we were in the drive business (like we told you the first time), and because digital music players were never going to compete with things like the Sony Discman or MiniDisc players; MP3s were just a fad. USB flash drives. Dave had been digging into flash memory and had learned that the yield for flash memory chips was extremely low, but many of the dies that were discarded because the weakest areas (where they test) failed to pass yield tests still had a lot of good chips &#8212; we just wouldn&#8217;t know which ones &#8212; and the fabs would sell us the chips at bargain basement prices. Since we&#8217;d been dealing with removable media for a long time, we had firmware algorithms developed to watch the media for failing sectors, and to reallocate these sectors to other healthy ones, completely transparently to the user. Because of this, and the recent development work done to have a USB-powered Zip drive, we pitched the idea of a USB-powered flash memory &#8220;drive&#8221; with no moving parts, compact size, and extremely low component cost. Marketing again declined, stating that they didn&#8217;t like that this could become a competing product to the Zip cash cow. We argued that it could still do that from a competing company, but they&#8217;d had enough &#8212; we had given them three bad ideas and they weren&#8217;t going to listen to any more of our pitches. Furthermore, the marketing director had a stern talk with the engineering director and the SkunkWorks was shut down. Did we know what we were talking about? You make the call. Oh, and one more stupid thing &#8212; management chose to completely ignore the whole Click Of Death controversy as a non-issue that really affected only a small percentage of users. Honestly, they were right about the non-issue part &#8212; we traced down the root cause of it all, and a driver change to the Windows 95 infinite-retry loop solved the problem &#8212; and they were right about the small percentage part (the return rate on the drives for this issue was very low), but they completely underestimated the black eye they got from the loudest voices on the Internet. We told them this, but, after all, we didn&#8217;t know anything about what we were talking about: we were just engineers. Most of us left the company not long after that.
