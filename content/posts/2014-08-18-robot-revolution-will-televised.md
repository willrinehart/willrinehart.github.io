A lot of stories about robot economics have popped up in the past couple weeks. Here is a couple of the most interesting:

  * [Human Needs Not Apply (Video)][1]
  * [AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs][2] from Pew
  * [Should your robot driver kill you to save a child’s life?][3]
  * [As machines take on more human work, what’s left for us?][4] from Pew

And for those who are interested, there is a blog dedicated to robot economics, called appropriately enough [RobotEconomics][5].
