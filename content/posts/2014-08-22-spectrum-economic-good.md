Over at Wet Machine, Harold Feld has penned an essay connecting Uber, copyright and spectrum. In it, he connects the

  Thanks to Derek Khanna and a number of others, Republicans are starting to see the wisdom in embracing some pro-tech policies where “property rights” is actually a code word for “government regulation.” Mind you, as a good member of the Congregation of Pragmatic Progressives rather than a follower of the Gods of the Marketplace, regulation to achieve good public policy ends doesn’t trouble me. For example, I have no problem with granting limited monopolies  “to promote the sciences and the useful arts” through copyrights and patents. I don’t need to lie to myself that copyright and patent are some magic species of property rather than an artificial monopoly defined and regulated by the government in order to sleep easy at night.

I find the discussion a compression of countless

Technically, the use of real property is also an artificial monopoly defined and regulated by the government as well.

Currently, spectrum is property-like, but we need to be clear what this means. As Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz point out

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  In common speech, we frequently speak of someone owning this land, that house, or these bonds. This conversational style undoubtedly is economical from the viewpoint of quick communication, but it masks the variety and complexity of the ownership relationship. What is owned are rights to use resources, including one&#8217;s body and mind, and these rights are always circumscribed, often by the prohibition of certain actions. To &#8220;own land&#8221; usually means to have the right to till (or not to till) the soil, to mine the soil, to offer those rights for sale, etc., but not to have the right to throw soil at a passerby, to use it to change the course of a stream, or to force someone to buy it. What are owned are socially recognized rights of action.

Taxi medallions are not property in this sense. It is not a right to use a resource per se, but a right to carry on a trade.

Of course, if the local government wanted to, it could just stamp more medallions.

Spectrum is not, but it is not easily excludeable either, much like

The rivalry that creates a need for property rights

There was a time when there was problems with interference because the perty rights where unknown and unclear&#8230;

      Medallions are not property, nor is the regime designed as such.

      IP is more akin to property because of the carveouts. See Epstein on this.

      The definition, allocation, and protection of property rights comprise one of the most complex and difficult sets of issues that any society has to resolve, but one that must be resolved in some fashion. For the most part, social critics of “property” rights do not want to abolish those rights. Rather, they want to transfer them from private ownership to government ownership. Some transfers to public ownership (or control, which is similar) make an economy more effective. Others make it less effective. The worst outcome by far occurs when property rights really are abolished (see<a class="blue" style="font-weight: bold; color: #6d6d0d;" href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/TragedyoftheCommons.html">tragedy of the commons</a>).

      A property right is the exclusive authority to determine how a resource is used, whether that resource is owned by government or by individuals. Society approves the uses selected by the holder of the property right with governmental administered force and with social ostracism. If the resource is owned by the government, the agent who determines its use has to operate under a set of rules determined, in the United States, by Congress or by executive agencies it has charged with that role.
