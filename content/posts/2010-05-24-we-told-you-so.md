[From the NYT:][1]

> PARIS — Across Western Europe, the “lifestyle superpower,” the assumptions and gains of a lifetime are suddenly in doubt. The deficit crisis that threatens the euro has also undermined the sustainability of the European standard of social welfare, built by left-leaning governments since the end of World War II.
> 
> Europeans have boasted about their social model, with its generous vacations and early retirements, its national health care systems and extensive welfare benefits, contrasting it with the comparative harshness of American capitalism.
> 
> But all over Europe governments with increasing budgets, falling tax revenues and aging populations are experiencing rising deficits, with more bad news ahead. 

Small government might be the only prudent way to run a government in the long term.
