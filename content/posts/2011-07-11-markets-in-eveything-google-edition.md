[Google is developing a data exchange:][1]

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Wall Street-like exchanges have revolutionized online advertising, but Google is taking the concept further, quietly building one for buying and selling data, the lifeblood of online advertising.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The exchange, known internally by the acronym &#8220;DDP,&#8221; is an attempt to create a liquid market for the data used to target display advertising, and it&#8217;s the latest move in Google&#8217;s attempt to build out the infrastructure that powers digital ads. Executives familiar with Google&#8217;s plans have described the initiative as one of the most ambitious in Google&#8217;s march to become a brand advertising giant.
