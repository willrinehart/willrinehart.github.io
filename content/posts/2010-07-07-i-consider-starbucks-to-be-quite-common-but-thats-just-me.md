[Great quote from Jason Kuznicki][1] talking about the recent ban of sugared soft drinks in vending machines in San Francisco:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Finally, I could point out that banning vending-machine drinks while leaving Starbucks untouched is a pretty rank example of class privilege at work — my indulgences are sophisticated and upper-class, while yours are vulgar and prole.

Quite frankly, I think Starbucks is pedestrian. [Intelligentsia][2] is the way to go.
