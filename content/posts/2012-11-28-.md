I am currently reading the paper &#8220;[Digital Feudalism: Enclosures and Erasures from Digital Rights Management to the Digital Divide][1]&#8221; by Sascha D. Meinrath, James W. Losey, and Victor W. Pickard. Two of the authors, Meinrath and Losey, are at the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Initiative, which provides a look into the thinking of that policy outfit.

The meat of the argument begins in the second section,

> The popular metaphor of the Internet as a public sphere often overlooks the darker side of this formulation. In discussing the structural transformations of the public sphere, Jürgen Habermas clarified that while the market helped create the initial space for civic engagement, it also constantly threatened to colonize public spheres through privatization. He referred to this phenomenon as the “re-feudalization of the public sphere,” a process in which the newly created public space would succumb to commercial pressures and reorganize along familiar power hierarchies. In recent years, Habermas has increasingly underscored the risk of market colonization, decrying the tendency toward treating the public sphere as merely another location for commercial relations to take hold.

They continue,

> A similar phenomenon, by analogy, is “enclosure,” a process by which private interests overtake common or public lands for the purpose of exploiting the lands to the exclusion of others. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the English countryside witnessed a sudden privatization of land that had long been treated as a commons. This change in the legal standing of the land criminal-ized a range of behavior that had previously been accepted as cultural norms, such as maintaining livestock and harvesting food or gleaning on common lands. With the advent of poor laws, these behaviors were suddenly re-categorized as poaching. Similarly, in the online context, enclosure systemati-cally removes resources out of the public sphere and replaces a general notion of maximizing the public good with a logic of profit maximization, thus excluding the majority of people and furthering the profits of a minority.

In public policy debates, metaphors and analogical thinking are commonplace, and for that reason, I think it is worth the time to more fully understand the structural underpinnings of these arguments by exploring them a bit.

For language and communication theorists, one of the most exciting and promising areas of research is the study of cognitive linguistics. This view is acutely physicalist, and rests on a simple premise &#8211; language and thought, because they are products of the human mind, are largely determined by the human body. Generally, this view is known as embodied philosophy, and because it is grounded in the body, has been widely accepted. It is a simple premise, but the implications are illuminating, especially for metaphors.

Key to the embodied view of philosophy is our method of learning, which for cognitive linguistics is rooted in metaphor. As the theory goes, to understand a new area of world, like love, we map it onto another domain, like a journey. As Lakoff and Johnson explained in their seminal work on this subject, we often hear love as being a journey,

  * They are at a crossroads in their relationship
  * This relationship isn&#8217;t going anywhere
  * They&#8217;re in a dead-end relationship

As you will notice, the second domain is physical and this is where the embodiment comes in. Metaphors are at the core of our thinking and are very persuasive. As we go from being a toddler to adolescence, the metaphors get more complex. We begin to leave the purely physical domain into other, more abstract areas. As Dierdre McCloskey explains it,

> The market for apartments in New York, says the economist, is just like a curve on a blackboard.  No one has so far seen a literal demand curve floating in the sky abover Manhattan. It&#8217;s a metaphor.

We have obtained a certain proficiency with mathematics in the last century or so and are able to use it to understand other areas more fully. By plotting data points of supply and demand, making lines from these datum, and then intersecting those two lines, we can understand what will happen given changes in supply, demand, price, etc. We understand the domain of real estate by connecting it to another, mathematics. But as the case tends to be, there is _mapping residuum_, conceptual connections made that are not appropriate for the metaphor. This is _the_ problem of metaphors and the crux of many horrible policy arguments. To say it another way, it is metaphorical overreach.

I make this point because in above quoted section by Meinrath et al., there is overreach. At various points in their article, the Internet is compared to a public sphere, to a commons, and then to the provision of public goods, each of which are distinct, but because they are conceptually so close, the reader is left with mapping residuum. Their major mistake is to confuse the abstract creation of a public space with the economic implications of commons and public goods. So let&#8217;s review some of the metaphors.

1 &#8211; The INTERNET is a COMMONS

The INTERNET is a COMMONS metaphor is a particularly rampant one in Internet studies. Borrowed from economics, it is a term that is often used imprecisely. Goods are typically understood by their rivalry and their excludability. A rival good is a good whose consumption prevents simultaneous consumption by others. We are well aware of rivalrous goods, like coffee and bananas. When I get up in the morning and drink my coffee and eat my banana, others cannot. However, when I watch a television broadcast through my TV, others also can partake in that good. So, it is said that TV broadcasts are non-rivalrous.

Goods are also understood by their excludability, which the ability of a producer to prevent people from having access to it. Combined, we get a two by two square, which includes four types of goods.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-480" title="excludable" src="http://blog.williamrinehart.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/excludable.bmp" alt="" />][2]

The commons denotes all goods where it is difficult to exclude people from consuming that good, which includes public goods and common pool resources. Access to the Internet is easily excludeable, so it is not a commons.

Later they admit as such,

> Another foundational pillar of this traditional thinking is that nonrivalrous goods are also non-excludable; that it is impossible to stop an individual from utilizing this resource (e.g., daylight, air, learning). In addition, rivalrous, yet non-excludable goods have given rise both to the “commons” and the dystopian “tragedy of the commons,” exemplified by problems like overfishing, overgrazing, and pollution of the environment.

Here we see the crux of the problem. Access to the network is excludable, but once this fee has been. Present within Habermas and this paper is what is perceieved as the proper role of market players in the

The INTERNET is a PUBLIC SPHERE

However

First off, lets discuss the public sphere. It is true that Jurgen Habermas did first theorize about this, but it was not until the 1980s and early 1990s that media historians took up the mantle and began to investigate the idea. The results complexified Habermas, and consequently much of Meinrath et. al.&#8217;s theoretical basis is questionable.

For example,

> What is at stake in this increasingly feudalized space is a shifting concept of ownership. What happens when public goods and common goods are re-envisioned as private goods? And how do regulatory processes and technological innovations spur these shifts? The “digital commons” metaphor may serve as a poignant reminder that the Internet’s unique power has rested largely on its openness, on the fact that it is our most public media, and that it was created as a result of public support through DARPA and other tax-supported entities, but it oversimplifies the multi-layered nature of the technology and the potential for enclosures to manifest themselves in seemingly innocuous ways.

As explained above, public goods are different than common goods. I also want to point out that the public

Also, there is the commons. Commons have two elements. They are all gifts and they are held in common.

The Internet as a Public Sphere

> Jürgen Habermas clarified that while the market helped create the initial space for civic engagement, it also constantly threatened to colonize public spheres through privatization.

This is the problem with the

The **public sphere** is an area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action. It is &#8220;a discursive space in which individuals and groups congregate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> The public sphere can be seen as &#8220;a theater in modern societies in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> and &#8220;a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup>
