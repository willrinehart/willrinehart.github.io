In reaction to what NYPD&#8217;s Police Benevolent Association chief Patrick Lynch calls a &#8220;hostile anti-police environment in the city,&#8221; officers are simply refusing to arrest or ticket people for minor offenses, leading to an overall arrest dropoff of nearly 66 percent.

Matt Taibbi [explains][1]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  If you&#8217;re wondering exactly what that means, the Post is reporting that the protesting police have decided to make arrests &#8220;only when they have to.&#8221; (Let that sink in for a moment. Seriously, take 10 or 15 seconds).
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8230;

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  It&#8217;s incredibly ironic that the police have chosen to abandon quality-of-life actions like public urination tickets and open-container violations, because it&#8217;s precisely these types of interactions that are at the heart of the Broken Windows polices that so infuriate residents of so-called &#8220;hot spot&#8221; neighborhoods.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  In an alternate universe where this pseudo-strike wasn&#8217;t the latest sortie in a standard-issue right-versus left political showdown, one could imagine this protest as a progressive or even a libertarian strike, in which police refused to work as backdoor tax-collectors and/or implement Minority Report-style pre-emptive policing policies, which is what a lot of these Broken Windows-type arrests amount to.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  But that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s going on here. As far as I can tell, there&#8217;s nothing enlightened about this slowdown, although I&#8217;m sure there are thousands of cops who are more than happy to get a break from Broken Windows policing.
