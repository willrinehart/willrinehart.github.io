[From the Colbert Report,][1]

> If I were only fact based, the book of books in literature would be the Manhattan phone directory â€“ 4 million entries everything correct, but it dusts out of my ears and I do not know, do they dream at night? Does Mr. Jonathan Smith cry in his pillow at night? We do not know anything when we check the correct entries in the phone directory.

As one of my professors used to say, ask interesting questions. This is exactly what Werner does. I can only image what world he lives in.
