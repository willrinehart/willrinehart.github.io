The number of people using Intrade has plummeted since a US government crackdown late last year. Alex Tabarrok points out

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The government failed to protect the public from CDOs plumped up with bad mortgages or from swindlers like Bernie Madoff but don’t worry when it comes to the markets that <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/promisepredmkt.pdf" target="_blank">Arrow, Schelling, Smith, Hanson, Wolfers et al.</a> said have “great potential for improving social welfare” the government has got it covered. Call me cynical but I suspect Intrade would have been better treated had it been a project of Goldman Sachs.
