<span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is costly and prone to failure. The evidence is collected below. [Updated last: July 22, 2020]</span>

_Large companies are investing a lot to solve hard problems._

<li dir="ltr">

    Google’s DeepMind lost roughly $162 million in 2016, <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to information filed with the UK government. (</span><a href="https://qz.com/1095833/how-much-googles-deepmind-ai-research-costs-goog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>

<li dir="ltr">
  Ocado, the UK based online supermarket, explained in late 2017 that the company would need to spend “an extra couple of million pounds” to hire software engineers to work on automating its warehouses. <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bafc1c00-9d0a-11e7-9a86-4d5a475ba4c5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>

  * Throughout 2017, Tesla founder Elon Musk was touting how the company would be implementing advanced robotics in the new factories. But after missing countless production estimates, he explained that &#8220;Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake.&#8221;
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">SAS is spending $1 billion on AI in the coming three years. (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span>][1]<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon.com will open an artificial intelligence research center in the German university city of Tuebingen. It joins BMW, Bosch, Daimler, Facebook and Porsche in backing a German initiative launched last year and focused on areas such as robotics, machine learning and computer vision. (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span>][2]<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">BMW and Daimler, long time competitors, have been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pooling resources</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to create autonomous vehicles.

_Progress in communication has been slow._

<li dir="ltr">
  <div>
    Facebook might have access to vast engineering resources and data about language, but still their chatbot project, M, fell short. According to one source familiar with the program, M never surpassed 30 percent automation. (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-virtual-assistant-m-is-dead-so-are-chatbots/">link</a>)
  </div>
</li>

  * <div>
      <span style="font-family: Cambria;">Microsoft’s Tay chatbot was pulled from Twitter less than 24 hours after it launched because it was repeating offensive and vile tweets.  </span><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Facebook tried to largely automate their content moderation process, but had to pull back on the project and has instead upped the number of content moderators. </span>

_Legacy companies struggle to upgrade._

    <span style="font-family: Cambria;">&#8220;Despite the hype and excitement, the majority of companies that commit to tackling AI projects will fail.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.datarobot.com/blog/why-most-ai-projects-fail/">link</a>)</span>

    According to a study performed by PriceWaterhouse Coopers and Iron Mountain, a staggering 43% of companies realize little actual benefit from their Big Data projects and a further 23% fail to realize any benefit at all.

  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Protiviti found that only 16 percent of business leaders are getting significant value from AI. (<a href="https://www.protiviti.com/US-en/insights/aiml">link</a>) </span>

<li dir="ltr">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveying a range of reports, IBM found that 25 percent of technology projects fail outright; 20 to 25 percent don’t show any return on investment; and as much as 50 percent need massive reworking by the time they’re finished. (<a href="https://ibmsystemsmag.com/Power-Systems/2/2012/7-reasons-it-projects-fail">link</a>)</span>

  A study by analysts Vanson Bourne for self service automation specialist SnapLogic looks at the data priorities and investment plans of IT decision makers, along with what&#8217;s holding them back from maximizing value. From a report:Among the findings are that 80 percent of those surveyed report that <a href="https://betanews.com/2018/07/11/outdated-tech-holds-back-business/">outdated technology holds their organization back from taking advantage of new data-driven opportunities</a>. Also that trust and quality issues slow progress, with only 29 percent of respondents having complete trust in the quality of their organization&#8217;s data. Nearly three-quarters (74 percent) say they face unprecedented volumes of data but struggle to generate useful insights from it, estimating that they use only about half (51 percent) of the data they collect or generate. What&#8217;s more, respondents estimate that less than half (48 percent) of all business decisions are based on data.

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail continues its relentless search for low cost supply chains.</span>_

  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares in Ocado, the UK based online supermarket that aims to reposition itself as a retail technology provider, fell on Tuesday morning after it said it would spend more than anticipated on developing new robot warehouses. I’m not sure it is appreciated how difficult and costly it is to develop automation tech. “The relatively robust results were overshadowed, however, after finance director Duncan Tatton-Brown told analysts that Ocado would spend “an extra couple of million pounds” this year on hiring software engineers to work on automating its warehouses.” (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span>][3]<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2017, Albertsons Companies, which owns over 2,200 grocery stores, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired the prepared</span>][4] <span style="font-weight: 400;">meal startup Plated.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 3, 2017, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walmart bought Parcel</span>][5]<span style="font-weight: 400;">, “a technology based, same-day and last-mile delivery company specializing in perishable and non-perishable delivery to customers in New York City.”</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">In December of 2017, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Target acquired Shipt</span>][6]<span style="font-weight: 400;">, a same-day delivery service platform, for $550 million in one of the companies largest deals.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid April of 2018, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walmart announced a deal</span>][7] <span style="font-weight: 400;">with Postmates to extend its online delivery to more than 100 metro areas.</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2018,</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kroger announced</span>][8] <span style="font-weight: 400;">that it had tapped the UK-based Ocado to pack online orders using the Ocado Smart Platform, which is staffed by robots.</span>
  * Then [Walmart announced][9] the launch of Alphabot, an automation system to help fill orders, that it has developed in collaboration with Alert Innovation.
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsa (2009) argues that existing retailers made new investments in inventory control and the like when Wal-Mart showed up in town. (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span>][10]<span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>

  * <span style="font-family: Cambria;">Google’s various end roads in robotics, “held the industry back more than moving it forward,” claimed one CEO. </span>
  * <span style="font-family: Cambria;">Automation is costly, so AI researchers and companies are now trying to address this by essentially turning the technology on itself, using machine learning to automate the trickier aspects of developing AI algorithms. (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608921/ai-algorithms-are-starting-to-teach-ai-algorithms/">link</a>)</span>
  * <span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, while </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses are aware of the importance of AI,</span>][11] <span style="font-weight: 400;">the process of adopting such technology has been slow, particularly among SMEs. A report from Bluewolf found that only one-in-five (21%) small businesses have implemented AI-based solutions.</span>
  * experts at OpenAI recently developed Dactyl, a robotic hand that could handle objects. This is a task that any human child learns to perform subconsciously at an early age. But it took Dactyl [6,144 CPUs and 8 GPUs][12]and about one hundred years&#8217; worth of experience to develop the same skills.
  * They conclude that the most promising explanation is that the practice reduces managerial overhead. As information technology improves and managements adapt to the new environment, this could imply that chains will begin to increase inter-store price variation. They note that &#8220;both drug stores and mass merchandise chains appear to have doubled the flexibility of their pricing&#8221; in 2012-14 compared to 2006-08. ([link][13])
  * Christopher Mims, writing for WSJ:The internet giants that tout their AI bona fides have tried to make their algorithms as human-free as possible, and that&#8217;s been a problem. It has become increasingly apparent over the past year that building systems without humans &#8220;in the loop&#8221; &#8212; especially in the case of Facebook and the ads it linked to 470 &#8220;inauthentic&#8221; Russian-backed accounts &#8212; can lead to disastrous outcomes, as actual human brains figure out how to exploit them. Whether it&#8217;s winning at games like Go or keeping watch for Russian influence operations, [the best AI-powered systems require humans to play an active role in their creation, tending and operation][14](Editor&#8217;s note: the link could be paywalled; [alternative source][15]). Facebook, of course, is now a prime example of this trend. The company recently announced it would add 10,000 content moderators to the 10,000 it already employs &#8212; a hiring surge that will impact its future profitability, said Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.
