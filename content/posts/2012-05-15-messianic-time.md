Some possible evidence for messianic time from &#8220;The Classical Tradition&#8221; by Gilbert Highet—

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The pictures on [the Franks Casket] show six different heroic scenes from at least three very distant ages:
</p>

  * Romulus, Remus and two wolves (c. 800  B.C.?);
  * the adoration of the Wise Men (A.D. 1);
  * the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans (c. A.D. 70);
  * the story of Weland and Beadogild (c. A.D. 400?);
  * and an unknown myth, as well as an inscription about the whale itself
