[Here is the hook for this Econlib feature article][1] 

> Many Americans may not realize that some of today&#8217;s political leaders and mainstream media espouse ideas that were discredited and left for dead over two hundred years ago. As in any number of horror flicks, sometimes the dead don&#8217;t stay that way.

You cannot deny the power of power.
