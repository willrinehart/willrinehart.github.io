[The evidence is building][1]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  According to a new-ish report, Vladmir Putin doesn’t so much oversee a<em> totalitarian</em> state as a <a href="http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/controlling_chaos_how_russia_manages_its_political_war_in_europe">“mobilization state”</a> – private, individual actors are mobilized for state purposes, without being directly controlled by the state. “The government is willing – within certain bounds – to accept the presence of civil society, a free press, independent economic activity, and even some political pluralism. However, in keeping with its general philosophical belief that it is at (political) war and faces an existential cultural and political threat from the West, it reserves to itself the right to co-opt any individual or organisation when it feels the need.” This is the new face of authoritarianism.
