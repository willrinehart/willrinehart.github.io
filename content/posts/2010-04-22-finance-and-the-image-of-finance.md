Apparently, China is getting their own [Charging Bull][1]. From the [Wall Street Journal][2],

> Crafted by a team of 40 in Wyoming, the new bull will stand on a newly built financial square that includes a four-faced screen of stock prices opposite the strip of iconic buildings known as Shanghai’s Bund. In the 1930s, the neoclassical buildings were headquarters of Asia’s most powerful banks but today are mostly boutiques, restaurants and hotels.
> 
> The city’s modern financial district sits across the river.

In other words, the bull is not going to be located in the financial center, separating finance from the image of finance. For the Chinese, who want to keep a wrap on things politically and economically, I think its telling that they&#8217;ve located the statute in an area that is sedate, apart from the turmoil of the markets.
