As mentioned above, these are the primary categories of spatial deixis, those words that provide information about a personâ€™s position in relation to her world and the people and objects in it. Because the body isthe central feature of all rationality.  
Most think now that the categories of deixis provide the grounding to all other symbolic/communication, and if we see language as embodied, space is primary. Thus, to suggest through arguments of fear that one of these groundings is going to change, is to quite literally shake the entire world of someone. Again, metaphor is not just cheap talk, it is the basis of everything. To get more of this, I would suggest reading Ruthrof&#8217;s &#8220;The Body in Language.&#8221;
