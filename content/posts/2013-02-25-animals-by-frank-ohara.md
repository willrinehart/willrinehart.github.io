  Animals by Frank O&#8217;Hara
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Have you forgotten what we were like then<br /> when we were still first rate<br /> and the day came fat with an apple in its mouth
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">
  it&#8217;s no use worrying about Time<br /> but we did have a few tricks up our sleeves<br /> and turned some sharp corners
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">
  the whole pasture looked like our meal<br /> we didn&#8217;t need speedometers<br /> we could manage cocktails out of ice and water
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I wouldn&#8217;t want to be faster<br /> or greener than now if you were with me O you<br /> were the best of all my days
