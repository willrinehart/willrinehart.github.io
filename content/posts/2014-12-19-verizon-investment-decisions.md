The telecom policy world continues to be enthralled with comments made by Verizon&#8217;s CFO on Title II reclassification and its impact on investment. Near the end of the conversation, Fran Shammo says,

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;I mean to be real clear, I mean [Title II reclassification] does not influence the way we invest. I mean we&#8217;re going to continue to invest in our networks and our platforms, both in Wireless and Wireline FiOS and where we need to. So nothing will influence that. I mean if you think about it, look, I mean we were born out of a highly regulated company, so we know how this operates. But related to this discussion around Net Neutrality, the FCC has the right to regulate under 765, they do not need to go to Title II, and why would you go to a 1930 piece of literature to try to regulate something that is a 21st-century technology.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8220;And I also think that if you look at other countries who have done this, it kind of leads you down to path of total failure because it really, really slows down investment and slows down innovation. So I guess the last comment is, it&#8217;s working, why do we need regulations around something that&#8217;s working. And again, they can do this under the realms of their legal ability. And I think if they go all the way to the extreme of Title II, I&#8217;ll quote what Randal said on stage about a month ago, which is, I think it&#8217;s going to be a very litigious environment.&#8221;

Many have interpreted this reaction as an admonition that Title II would not affect the industry. Upon reading the entire exchange, the truth is far less convincing that many have portrayed. Hal Singer has done a [great job explaining some of the basics here][1], but I just wanted to expand a bit on some of the core concepts and review what Singer lays out.

Every financial manager is pressed with two separate questions: what assets should be invested in, and how should the funds be raised. The first question is called the investment or capital budgeting decision while the second is the financing decision. Investments in the business, typically known as capital expenditures (cap-ex for short), are of one of two kinds, either maintenance cap-ex or growth cap-ex. While the first kind of cap-ex is needed for sustained revenue streams, the second is for new projects. So, when Shammo says that &#8220;we&#8217;re going to continue to invest in our networks and our platforms, both in Wireless and Wireline FiOS and where we need to,&#8221; what he means is that Title II will not change decisions made to maintenance cap-ex. To the investors in the room, this is a clear sign that current revenue streams will continue. Yet, he was not completely clear on how much was going out the door, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get into what we&#8217;re going to spend in 2015,&#8221; yet, &#8220;the day that we start to cut Wireless CapEx, that&#8217;s the day that we should start to wonder where the future of the business is going.&#8221;

Taken a whole, the conversation is largely about maintenance and not about growth. So, how would those decisions be made?

Any decision to invest follow from a few simple rules, which root finance theory. As we all know, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, and a safe dollar is worth more than a risky dollar. From these two ideas, core investment rules are born. Among the most important is the rate of return rule: _invest when the rates of return on the project exceed the opportunity cost cost of capital_. In other words, invest when the return on a project is greater than another potential investment activities with the same amount of risk. For firms, this choice is made via the

Thus, while Title II might not change capital budgeting, that doesn&#8217;t mean it will not change those financial decisions.

Capital budgeting decisions (investments) are different than capital financing decisions (how to raise the money by selling securities). To say that you will continue to invest is one thing, but this comes at a higher price.

All things being equal, a business operating in an industry that requires substantial annual CapEx just to maintain existing revenue and profitability will be valued less than a business operating in an industry where annual maintenance CapEx is lower. This is why the change in the
