  Noah Berlatsky <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/why-isnt-academic-research-free-to-everyone/382917/?single_page=true">has an interview</a> with humanities scholar Martin Paul Eve on why academic research in the humanities should be free and open. As Eve points out, the contrast between the humanities and the sciences is intriguing here as there are far more journals in the sciences that are free and open to the public as compared to the humanities, . He claims that, &#8220;There&#8217;s definitely a drive by center-right governments to open up scientific research so that it can be commercially exploited.&#8221; Governments of all stripes have done this, not just the center-right. What I find interesting is his discussion on copyright and reputation:

    Copyright, on the other hand, is a time-limited monopoly on the right to sell the result of intellectual labor. Because academics do not need to sell their work, they also don&#8217;t need the economic protections of copyright. Publishers do (if they sell work) but academics don&#8217;t.

  <p dir="ltr" style="color: #000000; padding-left: 30px;">
    What academics want is reputational protection. They want to be cited. Open licensing provides a way in which academics can let others use their work more liberally than if it were covered totally by copyright but always with the demand for attribution, which fuels their systems of prestige, hiring, etc.
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr" style="color: #000000; padding-left: 30px;">
    We designed a system to free academics from the market. We then came up with a model for research dissemination that entailed selling work (i.e., is market based).
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
    Eve is confusing &#8220;the market&#8221; as most call the price system with any market. What he means by reputational protection is actually the academic reputational market. Economic thinking cannot just be wished away. Even if we accept the bold claim that the humanities intends to be separate from the market, that doesn&#8217;t make it so. The concept of capital has always applied and the forces of competition will always exist.
  </p>
  
  <p dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
    Some basics: Knowledge capital is expensive to create, so limiting its access makes it depreciate slower. This is especially true in the humanities where a PhD can take 8 or 9 years. If all of your sister institutions have access to these journals but the outside world doesn&#8217;t, then you have limited the capital writedown writ large. For the humanities,

  Is it Pareto optimal? Probably not. But is it hurting innovation? Likely not.
