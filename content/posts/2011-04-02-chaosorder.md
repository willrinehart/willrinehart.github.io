The remnants from the Enlightenment project sill impose a constraint on our thinking. Two of the core tenants that we have inherited are that

  1. there is an order/harmony, and
  2. it precedes our existence in it

This continues to be one of the defining features of Western thought. Campbell, in his glorious contribution to this side of criticism, made note of the difference between the East and the West in this regard. In our origin story, God establishes time in the same breath that he/she creates the animals and humanity. Order, then, is created. For the East, however, this is not the case. Much like Plato&#8217;s version of creation, first there is one. Then this one separates itself, creating animals, etc. There is no implication of order or even of time, both are seen as multiplicities, as constructs that we place upon the world.
