[Google&#8217;s in-house philosopher explains his conversion from technologist to humanist,][1]

> In learning the limits of my technologist worldview, I didn&#8217;t just get a few handy ideas about how to build better AI systems. My studies opened up a new outlook on the world. I would unapologetically characterize it as a personal intellectual transformation: a renewed appreciation for the elements of life that are not scientifically understood or technologically engineered.
> 
> In other words: I became a humanist.
> 
> And having a more humanistic sensibility has made me a much better technologist than I was before. I no longer see the world through the eyes of a machineâ€”through the filter of what we are capable of reducing to its logical foundations. I am more aware of how the products we build shape the culture we are in. I am more attuned to the ethical implications of our decisions. And I no longer assume that machines can solve all of our problems for us. The task of thinking is still ours.

The last paragraph is the nitgraf,

> It is a convenient truth: You go into the humanities to pursue your intellectual passion; and it just so happens, as a by-product, that you emerge as a desired commodity for industry. Such is the halo of human flourishing.
