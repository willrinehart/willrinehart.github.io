  Ebola spreads because of a lack of organized health institutions. NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/10/06/354054915/firestone-did-what-governments-have-not-stopped-ebola-in-its-tracks?sc=tw">recently reported</a> on the health outcomes at Firestone&#8217;s rubber plantation in Harbel, Liberia, which has been successful in containing the disease, and on Reddit, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/2ik5gx/firestone_did_what_governments_have_not_stopped/">a user explains</a> one important part of the economic story that is left out:

  This isn&#8217;t just a case of rich western company vs poor downtrodden third world citizens; the problem in Liberia is a lack of advanced infrastructure. Without that, fighting ebola is much more difficult. But in this town, while it&#8217;s true that there is backing and resources, there are also good incentive structures. The market pushed a private company to invest in infrastructure, and the value of the assets in Harbel meant that Firestone&#8217;s and the community&#8217;s incentives were aligned which made this such a success story.
