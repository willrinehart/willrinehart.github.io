Famously, Stewart Brand noted that &#8220;information wants to be free.&#8221; But, that statement leaves off the other half of the phrase, thus burying the complexity of his thinking. In [an email][1], he explained,

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  In fall 1984, at the first Hackers&#8217; Conference, I said in one discussion session: &#8220;On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it&#8217;s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.&#8221;
</p>

He continues in his book, &#8220;The MIT Media Lab&#8221;:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy, and recombine&#8212;too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about price, copyright, &#8216;intellectual property&#8217;, the moral rightness of casual distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse, not better.
