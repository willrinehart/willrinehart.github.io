[Anil Dash doesn&#8217;t mince words,][1]

> How many times have you seen a website say &#8220;We&#8217;re not responsible for the content of our comments.&#8221;? I know that when you webmasters put that up on your sites, you&#8217;re trying to address your legal obligation. Well, let me tell you about your _moral_ obligation: Hell yes, you **are** responsible. You absolutely are. When people are saying ruinously cruel things about each other, and you&#8217;re the person who made it possible, it&#8217;s 100% your fault. If you aren&#8217;t willing to be a grown-up about that, then that&#8217;s okay, but you&#8217;re not ready to have a web business. Businesses that run cruise ships have to buy life preservers. Companies that sell alcohol have to keep it away from kids. And people who make communities on the web have to moderate them.

The entire article is worth a read.
