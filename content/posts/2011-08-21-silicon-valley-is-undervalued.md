[Marc Andreesen][1]:

> Too much of the debate is still around financial valuation, as opposed to the underlying intrinsic value of the best of Silicon Valley&#8217;s new companies. My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy. <a name="U502758931138WMD"></a>

> More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online servicesâ€”from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.
