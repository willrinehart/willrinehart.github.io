> Classifieds site Craigslist has been linked with 330 crimes, 12 murders and 105 robberies or assaults in the United States last year due to anonymous interactions on the site, says a new study.

Even if this weren&#8217;t a story paid for by a competitor, [which Mike Masnick explains is indeed the case][1], Craiglist, as a community is still a better place than most. That&#8217;s a little bit of an understatement, actually. With its almost 50 million users, if Craigslist were made into city, it would be 200 times safer than the rest of the country (source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime\_in\_the\_United\_States][2]), even with casual encounters, rideshares, personals and childcare. If only Chicago could be that safe&#8230;
