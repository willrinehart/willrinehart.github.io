From FL Lucas&#8217; book aptly titled _Tragedy_

> There, face to face, stand arrayed the opposite ideals &#8211; Apollo and Dionysus, the god of Dorian discipline and the god of the license of the wild. Yet both are Greek both lay claim to wisdom: and instead of burning the votaries of Dionysus at the stake, when we came storming on a wave of enthusiasm from the fastnesses of Thrace, the priests of Apollo gave his untamed younger brother, the son likewise of Zeus, a share in Apollo&#8217;s temple beneath the twin crags of Delphi. That reconciliation is typical of Greek balance , clarity and good sense &#8211; &#8220;nothing too much,&#8221; not even righteousness. (p. 50)

That last line is perfect. Nothing too much, not even righteousness.
