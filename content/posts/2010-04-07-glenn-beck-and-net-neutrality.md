This week Glenn Beck has been railing against net neutrality. For someone who has been watching this debate unfold over the past two years, it is interesting how he is framing the debate:

The question is not necessarily about net neutrality, every wants to keep the Internet open. The question is how do we accomplish this. 

What Beck does well, but hardly gets credit for, is the construction of a metanarrative of history. In the last fifty years or so, the presence of a metanarrative or &#8220;an abstract idea that is thought to be a comprehensive explanation of historical experience or knowledge&#8221; has been a hotly debated issue within academia. What I think makes Beck both intriguing and popular is his metanarrative, which is simple yet powerful. In short, recent history can be explained as a struggle between statist progressives personified in Obama and common Americans who believe in traditional ideals.

This is where McChesney fits in. He works perfectly as a progressive foil to Beck. Even though it is a little clumsy, his characterization of McChesney is closer than those over at Free Press are willing to admit. He is not really a Marxist, but rather a Post-Marxist, which makes all the difference. For the net neutrality debate, though, I wouldn&#8217;t consider him an intellectual heavy hitter, like Tim Wu, Lawrence Lessig or Adam Thierer. With a little bit of digging, it is easy to see the oversimplification. 

There is a lot to learn about this debate, and in the coming months, I hope to blog more about Beck, metanarratives and net neutrality. But, if you want a good introduction to the debate here are some places to start:
