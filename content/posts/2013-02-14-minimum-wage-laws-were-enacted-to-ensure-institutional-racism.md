A little known [fact][1]:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Minimum-wage laws date to the 1930s, and supporters in Congress at the time were explicit about using them to stop blacks from displacing whites in the labor force by working for less money. Milton Friedman regarded the minimum wage as &#8220;one of the most, if not the most, anti-black laws on the statute books.&#8221;

If that isn&#8217;t institutional racism, then I don&#8217;t know what is.
