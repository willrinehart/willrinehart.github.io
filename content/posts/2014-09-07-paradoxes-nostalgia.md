Svetlana Boym has a fascinating [article on nostalgia][1]. Here are some choice parts:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The nostalgia that interests me here is not merely an individual sickness but a symptom of our age, an historical emotion.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Nostalgia appears to be a longing for a place, but it is actually a yearning for a different time—the time of our childhood, the slower rhythms of our dreams. In a broader sense, nostalgia is a rebellion against the modern idea of time, the time of history and progress. The nostalgic desires to turn history into private or collective mythology, to revisit time like space, refusing to surrender to the irreversibility of time that plagues the human condition. Hence the past of nostalgia, to paraphrase William Faulkner, is not even past. It could be merely better time, or slower time—time out of time, not encumbered by appointment books.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Nostalgia, in my view, is not always retrospective; it can be prospective as well. The fantasies of the past, determined by the needs of the present, have a direct impact on the realities of the future.

Interesting essay throughout.
