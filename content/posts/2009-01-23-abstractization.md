In the past year, it has occurred to me that late modernity is different from all others because of one feature, its abstract nature.

Think about these situations:

When was the last time that you paid in cash? Have you ever seen the apple tree that gives you your Braeburns? How many of us drive cars, separated from the world by steel, shatter resistant glass and talking GPS systems?

The trouble with modern life, and the reason I think people have such a hard time finding meaning, is the continual abstractization of institutions. Our lives aren&#8217;t necessarily getting more complex, they are getting more abstract, more intangible. This is especially true in work environments. Paychecks are now numbers on a online banking statement. Spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations and phone calls are the tools of trade, not hammers and plows. 

In &#8220;[Metaphors We Live By][1],&#8221; Lakoff and Johnson argue that spatial relationships undergird much of our cognitive and linguistic processes. It is not a stretch, then, to see how the lack of tactile items can lead to a loss of meaning.
