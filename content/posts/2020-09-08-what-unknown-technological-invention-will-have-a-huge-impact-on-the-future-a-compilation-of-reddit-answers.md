On Reddit, [it was asked][1], what&#8217;s a relatively unknown technological invention that will have a huge impact on the future? As expected, there were countless great examples, so I compiled them below and tried to organize them by topic.

Biotechnology and medicine

  * [Microgel will be used to repair spines][2]
  * [Research][3] into bacteriophages could cure antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA.
  * [Gene therapy][4] will wildly proliferate.
  * [Wireless ECG machines][5] will be more widely used.
  * Implants are being developed which [can grow with kids][6]. Importantly, children with faulty heart valves or damaged organs which require a synthetic element can undergo just one surgery.
  * Bio chips are now a reality of sorts. Means we can test various drugs and treatments on your genetics without doing it on you.
  * Printed human skin and organs.
  * AI/ML algorithms for medical imaging

Energy, material, and minerals

  * Carbon grids will eventually reproduce the catalytic effects of Rhodium metal, commonly used in catalytic converters. “Rhodium metal is currently trading at $[13,000/oz][7] after a huge spike due to worldwide emissions restrictions that took effect in 2020.”
  * Old landfills will be mined by bots to extract useful elements.
  * [Lithium sulfur batteries][8] are being developed to replace lithium ion batteries, but are difficult to produce.
  * [Low-pressure solar-powered drip irrigation systems][9].
  * [Transparent solar panels could replace window glass][10].
  * Biologically-derived electrodes/batteries
  * Advanced nanocomposite materials for magnetic devices
  * Carbon nanotube technologies.
  * [Photocatalytic paint][11] will break down air pollutants into harmless compounds.

Robotics and transportation

  * Hypersonic missiles.
  * [SABRE engines][12] are hypersonic precooled hybrid air-breathing rocket engines, designed to achieve single-stage-to-orbit capability.
  * Agricultural robotics (pickers, sorters, computer visions for identification (phenotypes for example), etc.)
  * Brain-to-computer interfaces
  * Widely deployed sensors
  * Autonomous drone-swarm technologies (applies to manufacturing, emergency rescue, mapping, etc.)
  * Emotion and identification recognition through voice, gait, etc. using AI/ML algorithms
