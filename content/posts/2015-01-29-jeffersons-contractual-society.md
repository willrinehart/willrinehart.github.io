When Jefferson said &#8220;The earth belongs to the living,&#8221; he was railing against the popular Burkean revision of Locke&#8217;s contractual society.

The quote comes from a letter to Madison and makes sense only in the broader debate between Burke and Paine:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The question Whether one generation of men has a right to bind another, seems never to have been started either on this or our side of the water. Yet it is a question of such consequences as not only to merit decision, but place also, among the fundamental principles of every government.
