I have been following a bit of this Common controversy and it just hit me that white people do not understand rap music can be metaphorical. I was think of the opposite side of this. Even if Common was making &#8220;cop killing&#8221; and incendiary remarks against Bush, that does not mean that he was going to do it. It is an allegory. Just because you kill someone in a lyric or a play or a movie, that does not mean that you hate them. It is an exploration, and a visceral one at that, of the tendencies of life. Metaphorically expressed violence contemplates our physically expressed violence. Denying this also means denying the existence of violence. It is truly a white washing of the issues.
