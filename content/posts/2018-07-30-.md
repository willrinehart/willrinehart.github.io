  In June, network neutrality rules supported by Title II were officially repealed, marking the end of the Obama-era legislation. A lot of people who are skeptical of the rules

  In response, Eric Null commented on Twitter:

  While I often respectfully disagree with Eric, I tend to agree with him on this. We do need to take a longer
</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">
  But to be fair, there have been a lot of doomsday predictions about a world with Title II based rules.
