Nowhere better illustrates the Hayekian concept of discovery than the current broadband market.

Suddenlink has announced its long-anticipated program to &#8220;progressively boost Internet speeds and make 1 Gbps service available to all the company&#8217;s customers,&#8221; the MSO said in a press release.

Based in St. Louis, Mo., Suddenlink serves 1.4 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia and elsewhere.

Operation GigaSpeed, as the effort has been labeled, will cost almost a quarter-billion dollars to fund, including network and in-home equipment and a total analog to digital conversion. It&#8217;s happening because 1 Gbps is becoming more than just a blip on consumer broadband radar, the nation&#8217;s seventh largest MSO said in the press release, emphasizing Suddenlink&#8217;s more rural customer base.
