Rereading this article, I was astonished by a couple of sentences:

> America&#8217;s drug problems functioned as opportunities for the imposition of an old moral agenda and the appearance of a new social concern. Moreover, the remedies that followed from this view were in perfect harmony with &#8220;traditional family values&#8221; &#8211; individual moral discipline and abstinence, combined with police and prisons for those who indulged. Such remedies avoided all questions about the economic and political sources of and solutions to America&#8217;s social problems.

And talking about the changes in the 1980s,

> They conceptualized people in trouble as people who make trouble (Gusfield 1985); they made social control rather than social welfare the organizing axis of public policy (Reinarman 1988).
