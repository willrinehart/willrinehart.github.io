Discussions of Internet privacy fail to clarify the environment that the individual finds herself in when exploring the online space. Especially in policy debates, this creates an intellectual deficit. Without a clear understanding of how the person relates to the technology, we can hardly understand how regulatory changes will actually affect both.

Facebook, Google+, and Twitter facilitate communication by creating online social environments. Generally, social network sites are distinguished from the rest of the tools on the Internet because they “allow individuals to construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, articulate through this profile a list of other users whom they share a connection, and view their list of connections and other similar lists of connection within the system.” The profile is the central feature.

Social networking sites are one of a wider group of technologies on the Internet that can be generally be contrasted to traditional media. In the traditional triad of mass media (newspapers, books and radio) communication is achieved in a one-to-many system. The web shifted this dynamic, allowing for communication to flow from many-to-many. From the view of the user, content shifted from a model of passive consumption to both consumption and production.

We should remember that online content is not monolithic. Together with others, users of SNS use online content to serve any number of the four major goals of media use &#8212; diversion, the development of personal relationships, the creation and exploration of personal identity and surveillance about the broader environment.  All too often, it is assumed that Facebook and Twitter are simple diversions, but the technology facilitates all kinds of media use.

For example, Pear Analytics conducted [a content analysis][1] in 2009 to see what kinds of messages were sent via Twitter. “Pointless babble” was the most prevalent kind of message, which was, in their own words, the “I am eating a sandwich now” tweets. Twitter, Facebook and other social networks are themselves criticized because of the content they deliver. Implicitly, i many seem to suggest that the structure of Twitter causes the messages to be pointless. Despite the moniker, the kinds of messages Pear Analytics describe as “pointless babble” would be more correctly described as phatic communication. It is not that the messages conveyed information, their purpose was to maintain social bonds.

The concept comes from the early 20th century from renown anthropologist Branislow Malinowski. In trying to understand languages he had never heard before, Malinowski realized there was &#8220;a type of speech in which the ties of union are created by a mere exchange of words” and so coined the term phatic communication. Originally trained as an economist, Malinowski migrated into sociology in his graduate years and saw similarities between communication and economics, each a form of cultural exchange. Where the first was concerned with ideas, the second was materialistic, and both were deeply connected with establishing and maintaining social bonds.

Later, the topic was taken up by communication scholar James Carey, who more formally expounded on the subject. Communication, he explained, could be conceptualized with two lenses. We could see it as transmission of information or as ritual. We send emails, read reports packed with information, and send texts. All are means to transmit information. However, the ritual view of communication is another ways of seeing communication. As Carey noted,

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  In a ritual definition, communication is linked to terms such as &#8220;sharing,&#8221; &#8220;participation,&#8221; &#8220;association,&#8221; &#8220;fellowship,&#8221; and &#8220;the possession of a common faith.&#8221; This definition exploits the ancient identity and common roots of the terms &#8220;commonness,&#8221; &#8220;communion,&#8221; &#8220;community,&#8221; and &#8220;communication,&#8221; A ritual view of communication is directed not toward the extension of messages in space but toward the maintenance of society in time; not the act of imparting information but the representation of shared beliefs.
</p>

The philosopher of language Wittgenstein once noted that “To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.” His point was not to be aphoristic, but to draw attention to the intimate connections between language and culture. Even though we use culture in a singular sense, it is simply a stand-in for the things we do every day. Language makes possible culture because it gives us the ability to exchange information, trade goods, discover each others preferences, engage in ethics and perform all the other actions we call life (or culture).

Returning to the Pear Analytics report, the “I am not eating a sandwich” tweets when taken together mean much more. Each individual Tweet might merely seem to be superfluous, but follow it for a day and  “_It begins to feel like a short story; follow it for a month, and it’s a novel._”

As another commenter noted,

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Each little update — each individual bit of social information — is insignificant on its own, even supremely mundane. But taken together, over time, the little snippets coalesce into a surprisingly sophisticated portrait of your friends’ and family members’ lives, like thousands of dots making a pointillist painting. This was never before possible, because in the real world, no friend would bother to call you up and detail the sandwiches she was eating.

When considered individually, Twitter and Facebook might be seen as instances of ritual communication. From a more long perspective, a kind of [epistolary novel][2] a deeply complex story, which pushes against a view that heavy use of Facebook is connected to social withdrawal.

[Recent][3] [studies][4] [of][5] heavy users on Facebook overwhelmingly support the opposite and more logical conclusion. Those who use Facebook more intensely, have much higher levels of life satisfaction, social trust, civic engagement, and political participation, each a positive story and a sign of socially connected individual. Because Facebook and other social media sites represent social networks in the most literal sense—they present again social ties of the real world—those who use these sites intensely often have fulfilling social networks offline.

Technology does impose limits as only certain kinds of behaviors are afforded by the technology. The most virulent form of this argument is the so called “walled garden” problem, that lock-in will create a form of soft despotism. [Add more here] But, a similar problem exists in books, newspapers and other traditional media. As we have seen, each technology expands the possibilities in both transmission and ritual, and thus for collaboration, experimentation, storage, and exploration like never before.

And even if the wall garden argument is correct, which is a big if indeed, the assumption that people are passive in their use of media is not. As a researcher noted,

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  With communication functions such as chat, adolescents are not at the mercy of an externally created environment; they are creating and, more to the point, co-creating their Internet environment through processes of social interaction.
</p>

As with all media, individuals create with each other (or co-create) their environment. The same kind of lesson could be applied to SNS. People are not so much at the mercy of the site, as they are using the site to explore their identity and create community.

Identity construction is _the_ major task for adolescents and young adults, and that is where this conversation will explore in the followup to this post.
