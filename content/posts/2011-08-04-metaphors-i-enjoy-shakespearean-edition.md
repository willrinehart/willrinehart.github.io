> Over the past three weeks, we’ve seen just about every act there is to this political theater and, staying true to the time of Shakespeare, it seems every character is played by a man. Odds are that if there were more women in these discussions, the crisis would have been resolved by now.

Is the debt ceiling really an issue that needs to be negotiated? Or, is it part of a horrible game? Adding in women to the mix would be interesting, but the rules have already been set.

Let&#8217;s consider some truths. Congress has already passed the budget. Now, they are saying, no we are not going to raise this arbitrary limit we have put on the debt because of President Obama&#8217;s reckless spending. Who exactly passes the budget? Oh yes, Congress. It is a game of posturing. I think I saw this once on the Discovery Channel between some chimps.

Tragedies have rules, but real life does not.
