I can&#8217;t add much in the gun control debate other than this: we have bigger problems.

We know th

Nor is i et even the case that such problems really threaten, but tend to be more

But of course, if those patriots actually truthfully cared about stopping a government then I would tend to think they would be more up in arms

It seems to me the gun control debate has sputtered down the wrong path. There are a number of politicans who worry about.

But at the end of the day only two major criticism really stop us. One is the abrigement of rights, and the other is that in times of armed insurrection, we shold be able to defend ourselves.

Police have been militarizing.
