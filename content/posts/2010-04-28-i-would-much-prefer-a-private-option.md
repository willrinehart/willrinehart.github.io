Jonah Lehrer has some good food for thought over at The Frontal Cortex. I think this paragraph says it all,

> The success of financial reform won&#8217;t ultimately depend on the precise details of derivative regulation, or the specific powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Instead, it will depend on whether or not reform has created a structure &#8211; either in the private sector or in government &#8211; where people are able to notice the red ten of spades before it&#8217;s too late. Every mind has blind spots; that&#8217;s an inevitable side-effect of knowledge. The key is to make sure not everyone is blind to the same thing.

I&#8217;d highly suggest [reading the entire post][1].
