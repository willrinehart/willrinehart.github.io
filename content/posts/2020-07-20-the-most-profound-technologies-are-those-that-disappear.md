A conversation today reminded me of [the old Mark Weiser piece][1], which begins, &#8220;The most profound technologies are those that disappear.&#8221; It continues,

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Such a disappearance is a fundamental consequence not of technology, but of human psychology. Whenever people learn something sufficiently well, they cease to be aware of it. When you look at a street sign, for example, you absorb its information without consciously performing the act of reading. Computer scientist, economist, and Nobelist Herb Simon calls this phenomenon &#8220;compiling&#8221;; philosopher Michael Polanyi calls it the &#8220;tacit dimension&#8221;; psychologist TK Gibson calls it &#8220;visual invariants&#8221;; philosophers Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger call it &#8220;the horizon&#8221; and the &#8220;ready-to-hand&#8221;, John Seely Brown at PARC calls it the &#8220;periphery&#8221;. All say, in essence, that only when things disappear in this way are we freed to use them without thinking and so to focus beyond them on new goals.
