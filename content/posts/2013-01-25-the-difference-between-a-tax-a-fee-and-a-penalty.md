The difference between a tax, a fee and a penalty is based on the purpose of the revenue.

  * A tax is a levy collected for general government services.
  * A fee is levy collected to provide a service that benefits the group of people from which the money is collected.
  * A penalty is a levy collected with the express aim of deterring some kind of undesirable behavior.

As tax economist Scott Drenkard explained to me, &#8220;This distinction became especially important recently when Justice Roberts went against over a century of tax jurisprudence by declaring the individual mandate to be a tax. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s a penalty.&#8221;

Obviously there is a spectrum here. A gas tax, which is used to fund roads, is more akin to a user fee, though they are still generally called Â taxes.
