To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.  
-Titus 1:15

Think about the first time that went to a friend&#8217;s house and saw that it was a mess. Clothes were strewn about, pots and pans were piled in the sink and the place smelled of something unnatural. What were your thoughts? Did you question the order in their life? Did you question their maturity? Of course you did. And how do movies express that a character is depressed or out of her element? A trashed or messy home. When you go to a new city, how do you judge the organization of the city? You judge by how clean it might be. 

There is a distinct relationship between cleanliness, or more broadly purity, and order. 

When you first meet someone There is a relationship that we do not often talk about, but that is vastly important.
