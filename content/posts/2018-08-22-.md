Earlier this week, the FTC closed the first round of comments for their [Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection][1]. I&#8217;m only now reading through the comments but already I can tell there is a lot worth reading and considering. So I thought it might be helpful to roundup all of the comments that I have seen so far.  
Up first for obvious reasons, I submitted three sets of comments. The first comment, titled “[Big Data Hubris][2],” explores the debate over competition and big data. In the end analysis, it advises that, “to fully appreciate the larger discussion surrounding big data, it is first necessary to understand a bit about big data and then understand how firms integrate these processes.” The second comment, “[Platform Competition And The Implications Of Amex][3],” aims to place the _Amex_ decision within the broader economic research on platforms. In total, I think “_Amex_ should be a cause for celebration. Economists and antitrust scholars have been actively working to extend traditional antitrust analysis to apply it to platform businesses. The Court agreed; the totality of the platform needs to be understood.” Finally, the comment titled “[Algorithmic Regulation And Consumer Welfare][4]” calls for caution in regulating algorithms. Algorithms are tools. While it is important to understand how well calibrated the tool is, researchers and competition authorities need to be focused on how the tool impacts real people working with and within institutions.  
Geoffrey A. Manne, Julian Morris, Justin (Gus) Hurwitz, and Kristian Stout over at the International Center for Law & Economics [submitted comments][5] on the state of antitrust and consumer protection law. Here is what they had to say about the paper:

  Much of our analysis is imbued with discussion of these issues as they relate to communication, information, and media technology networks, many of which are considered “platform businesses.” However, we stress that, while there are issues that are peculiar to certain kinds of businesses, such as platforms, the fundamental principles of good antitrust policy are not dependent on the type of business being analyzed. Rather, good antitrust policy is undergirded by sound economic analysis and solid empirical evidence, regardless of the type of business being analyzed. The same lessons apply to consumer protection policy.
