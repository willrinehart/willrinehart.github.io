> Critics argue that personalization, especially when it comes to news stories, can be detrimental, narrowing people’s viewpoints and reinforcing established perspectives. In his book _<a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/" target="_hplink">The Filter Bubble</a>_, Eli Pariser <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/07/eli-pariser-facebook-google-ted_n_832198.html" target="_hplink">argues</a> that editing via algorithms “moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.”

I think that’s something that people who talk about social consciousness forget…. It’s not clear that that has a lot of value to the user … It’s a really complicated question.”

It is actually not a complicated question. Quite frankly, I think this is a concern for people who are digital immigrants and not those who are digital natives. To refresh your memory, digital natives are those who were born after the information technology boom of the 70s and 80s and have lived most of their lives with computers. The delineation between natives and immigrants is that the identities of natives (full disclosure: I am a digital native) have been largely constructed in a mixed environment of  online and offline. Digital immigrants are dissimilar in this regard. They have largely lived their lives offline.

I continue with a bit of the Wik, as I am now calling the addictive substance known as Wikipedia:

> Education, as [Marc Prensky][2] states, is the single largest problem facing the digital world as our Digital Immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated language (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach a population that speaks an entirely new language

I think it would be great if it were just a language issue, as though a pidgin would help bridge the issue. But, alas, it is not. This is not just communication or language, though some could persuasively argue that it is tied together. Digital natives have a completely different frame of reference. Their world view is shaped by their interactions and experiences online. And, as countless reports have shown, natives are much more savvy about media than older generations. Their consumption of media is much more sophisticated. Furthermore, there is not an outline of what should be done anyway. There is no one who knows the right mix of media for. At some point we have
