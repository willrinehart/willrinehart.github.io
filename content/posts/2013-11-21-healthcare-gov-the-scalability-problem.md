[Scalability problems][1] plague the creation of large web sites. This is especially poignant, given the Healthcare.gov web site fiasco:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Large systems, too complex for individual comprehension, must be subdivided into smaller tasks coordinated between groups. In fact, a large portion of software engineering is devoted to the documentation, notification, and management review needed to coordinate large projects.
</p>

Thus, it is [not uncommon][2] for large IT projects like this to have overrun costs or fail:

  <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/business/it-myth-5-most-it-projects-fail-008">One study</a> shows that 34 percent of projects are unqualified successes, 15 percent are complete failures which were abandoned before completion, and the remaining 51 percent, like healthcare.gov, fall somewhere in between.
