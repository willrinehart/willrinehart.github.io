I am going to begin using this page as a place to outline my theory of the Bureaucratic State

  * [In bureaucracies many people have the authority to say no, not the authority to say yes][1].
  * It is in vogue to prognosticate on the ephemeral features of our society. The postmodern turn it is called. But  a full application of this very simple viewpoint still lacks with regard to the bureaucratic state. It is a topic I want to pick up and explore.
  * The multiplicity of identities begs us to rethink the position of the State in society.
