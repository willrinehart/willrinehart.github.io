The literature on this topic has been hotly debated since Philip Grossman first explored the subject in 1989. Grossman developed a model that incorporates both Pivogian and Public Choice ideas to estimate the optimal size of government by using government output as an input for private sector output. When the government is small, the government tends to be Pigovian, directing it towards actions that generally serve the public, but as the government grows, it increasingly comes under the control of interest groups who seek to exploit its wealth and power, the Public Choice view of government. By using a model to determine when the government goes from being Pigovian to Public Choice, Gross estimated that in 1982 government output was approximately 87 percent higher than what it should have been.

His model is
