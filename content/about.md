My name is Will and I’m currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in the intersection between technology and society.

Before CGO, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the [American Action Forum][1]. I also worked at [TechFreedom][2] as a Research Fellow and was previously the Director of Operations at the International Center for Law & Economics. In the summer of 2009, I got my start in the world of tech policy as a Koch Summer Fellow at The Progress & Freedom Foundation, concentrating on advertising policy and Internet governance. Previous to this, in 2008, I was a Research Associate at the Illinois Policy Institute, where I studied state-level budget, energy and tax issues. Additionally, I have worked for the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement in Chicago as the Research Assistant in Technology and Civic Engagement.

I am also currently a Fellow at the Internet Law & Policy Foundry and a Frédéric Bastiat Fellow at the Mercatus Center. Additionally, I serve on the Federal Communications Commission’s Broadband Deployment Committee and Consumer Advocacy Committee. I also serve as an expert at the Federalist Society’s Emerging Technology Working Group, which is part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.

My work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Wired, Morning Consult, The Hill, Forbes, Reason, Marginal Revolution, Overlawyered, and on BBC Radio and NPR, just to name a few. I speak regularly on topics related to tech policy, have been cited in regulatory orders from the FCC, and have been featured in Supreme Court petitions. I hold a BA in Political Science from the University of Illinois and a MS in Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University.
