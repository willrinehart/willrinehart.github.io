Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy piled on, describing the drop as “a privacy wake-up call that the markets are delivering to Mark Zuckerberg.”
But the downward pressure was driven by more fundamental changes. Simply put, Facebook missed its earnings target. But it is important to peer into why the company didn’t meet those targets." />

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy piled on, describing the drop as “a privacy wake-up call that the markets are delivering to Mark Zuckerberg.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the downward pressure was driven by more fundamental changes. Simply put, Facebook missed its earnings target. But it is important to peer into why the company didn’t meet those targets.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Zuckerberg noted <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4190221-facebook-fb-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the earning call<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Later in the call, Facebook CFO David Wehner signaled total revenue growth rate would decelerate due to the choices made by Zuckerberg,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moreover, the costs would continue to rise as they also embedded more privacy and security features into the platform:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, Facebook got hammered because it invested more in privacy and security, while also transitioning to less revenue generating source of content. At first glance, this might seem to signal from the market to not invest in these sort of changes. Indeed, as <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://twitter.com/blakereid/status/1022666601752027137"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blake Reid noted<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes and no.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It has been widely accepted that corporations often adopt short term strategies that attempt to maximize earnings. As <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10550"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->one well cited survey<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of financial executive explained, “Because of the severe market reaction to missing an earnings target, we find that firms are willing to sacrifice economic value in order to meet a short-run earnings target.” <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This preference for the near term, especially for payoffs in the near term, seems to be a common <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.nyu.edu/econ/user/bisina/FredLoew.pdf"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->feature among humans<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. People tend to prefer small rewards that occur now over much larger rewards that come later. This is known as hyperbolic discounting and it helps to explain why <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w5635"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->households under-save<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4077625/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->why smokers find it tough to quit<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and why firms prefer near term earnings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pulling together the insights from finance and behavioral psychology, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://globalpoverty.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/592wp_0.pdf"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->two economists<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pointed out “that a firm exhibiting hyperbolic discounting preferences faces an underinvestment problem, i.e. there exists another feasible investment plan that improves all periods’ present values.” Conversely, a firm exhibiting time invariant preferences would invest, even if it meant a short term hit.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook is probably playing the long game. Zuckerberg has an overwhelming <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/shareholders-wont-force-zuckerbergs-hand-in-facebook-management.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->controlling stake<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the company and wants <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/dealbook/facebook-bottom-line.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->to build value in the long term<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And if these changes lead to more durability, that is, if users stay on the site longer in the next 5 or 10 years, then it makes sense to take the short term hit. It would be better to do this than have a massive exodus at some point down the road.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the same kind of way, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2013/10/former-amazon-employee-examines.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon has been criticized<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for years for spending too much money on company investments to the detriment of returns. But, Amazon’s Q2 2018 numbers came in this week and they were <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://investorplace.com/2018/07/amazon-amzn-stock-homerun-quarter-near-perfect-stock/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->double expectations<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Bezos’ 1997 shareholder letter laid out the strategy, “We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term.” Bezos is also more concerned with building for the long term. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m working on a more formal model of this, but I think there are reasons to believe that Facebook would be especially sensitive to privacy concerns. And Facebook’s missing earnings also point to a real concern about the long term viability of the platform. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
