  <title> The Online Public Sphere or: Facebook, Google, Reddit, and Twitter also support positive communities | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

<meta property="og:description" content="In cleaning up my desk this weekend, I chanced upon an old notebook and like many times before I began to transcribe the notes. It was short, so I got to the end within a couple of minutes. The last page was scribbled with the German term Öffentlichkeit (public sphere), a couple sentences on Hannah Arendt, and a paragraph about Norberto Bobbio’s view of public and private. 
Then I remembered. Yep. This is the missing notebook from a class on democracy in the digital age.   
Serendipitously, a couple of hours later, William Freeland alerted me to Franklin Foer’s newest piece in The Atlantic titled “The Death of the Public Square.” Foer is the author of “World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech,” and if you want a good take on that book, check out Adam Thierer’s review in Reason. 
Much like the book, this Atlantic piece wades into techno ruin porn but focuses instead on the public sphere:" />

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Much like the book, this Atlantic piece wades into techno ruin porn but focuses instead on the public sphere:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In recent years, this has been eviscerated by Facebook and Google, Foer continues,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Philosopher Jurgen Habermas, who is cited throughout the piece, coined the term Öffentlichkeit, which has been translated into English as public sphere. However, Habermas used the term to describe not only the “process by which people articulate the needs of society with the state” but <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=V7cLBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=as+a+virtual+or+imaginary+community+which+does+not+necessarily+exist+in+any+identifiable+space&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dzMf6r0Ds5&amp;sig=AmroaJbNtQeaBugnLTtrKtaTPho&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZtr3vn5XcAhWQrFMKHX8gDYEQ6AEIhgEwEA#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20a%20virtual%20or%20imaginary%20community%20which%20does%20not%20necessarily%20exist%20in%20any%20identifiable%20space&amp;f=false"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->also<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the “public opinion needed to legitimate authority in any functioning democracy.” So, the public bridges the practices of democracy with mass communication methods like broadcast television, newspapers, and magazines.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->While Foer doesn’t explore it fully, the public sphere forms a basis for legitimate authority, which in turn implicates political power. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/466240?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nancy Fraser<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->provided the classic critique of public sphere because even in Habermas’ own conception of the term, countless voices were excluded from the public sphere. “This network of clubs and associations – philanthropic, civic, professional, and cultural – was anything but accessible to everyone,” Fraser explained. “On the contrary, it was the arena, the training ground and eventually the power base of a stratum of bourgeois men who were coming to see themselves as a ‘universal class’ and preparing to assert their fitness to govern.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In parallel to the public sphere, Fraser observed that numerous counterpublics formed “where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counter discourses to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs.” And it is through these oppositional interpretations that the public conversation around politics changed. Think about civil rights and the environmental movement, and even deregulation as examples. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foer might be right to focus on the public sphere, but I’m not sure his analysis goes far enough. He explains:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But Foer’s lament, if it is about the public sphere, is ultimately about the old friction, between the public sphere and counterpublics, in new form. Foer’s worries about theological zealots, demagogic populists, avowed racists, trollish misogynists, filter bubbles, the false prophets of disruption, and invisible manipulation, just to name a couple techno-golems, echoes the “counter discourses [that] formulate oppositional interpretations” of Fraser.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is all quite inhumane, yes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But let’s also remember that Facebook and Google and Reddit and Twitter also support humane counterpublics. Like when chronic pain sufferers <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-straw-gold/201201/in-defense-facebook"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->find solace on Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Or when widows vent, rage, laugh and cry without judgement through <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/the-hot-young-widows-club-is-out-to-change-the-way-we-grieve"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Hot Young Widows Club<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Let’s also not forgot that Reddit, while sometimes being a place of rage and spite, is also where a weight lifter with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/7jc48d/image_adaptive_athlete_with_cerebral_palsy/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->cerebral palsy became a hero<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and where those with <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5pb2u4/exaddicts_of_reddit_what_was_your_rock_bottom/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->addiction can find healing<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let’s also not forget <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/12/08/better-informed/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->that most Americans think<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> these companies have on the whole been beneficial in their lives. And that most of us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don’t post political content<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on either Facebook or Twitter. And that people are the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->least likely<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get their news from social networking sites compared to every other source.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Focusing on democracy and on politics tightens the critical vision, causing us to miss the multiplicities of experiences online. Yet those experiences, those counterpublics are just as representative. They constitute a reality far more real than those constructed by critics.</p>
