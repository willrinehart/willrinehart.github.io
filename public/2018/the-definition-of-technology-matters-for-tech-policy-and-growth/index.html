  <title> The Definition of Technology Matters For Tech Policy And Growth | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

    <p>Dan Wang has <a href="https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/">a new post</a> titled “How Technology Grows (a restatement of definite optimism)” and it is characteristically good. For tech policy wonks and policymakers, put it in your queue. The essay clocks in at 7500 words, but there’s a lot to glean from the piece. Indeed, he puts into words a number of ideas I’ve been wanting to write about. To set the stage, he begins first by defining what we mean by technology:</p>

<p>As he rightly points out, the United States has, for various reasons, set aside the focus on process knowledge. Where this is especially evident comes in our manufacturing base:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The US is <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-needs-more-manufactured-exports">an outlier among</a> rich countries when it comes to manufacturing exports. It needs improvement.</p>
<p>Two comments on this.<br>
First off, I couldn’t agree more with Dan’s emphasis on the localization of knowledge. Local knowledge networks made Silicon Valley what it is. By far the best dive into this topic is still Annalee Saxenian’s “Regional Advantage,” which charts the computer industry’s genesis in both Silicon Valley and along Boston’s Route 128. As she details throughout the book, the culture of work and the resulting firm structures in Silicon Valley differed significantly from those in Boston, giving it critical advantages to become the preeminent region of technology development.<br>
When I read it a couple of years back, <a href="http://www.williamrinehart.com/2014/genesis-career-entrepreneur/">I highlighted</a> the importance of regional knowledge hubs:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Without them, an industry can lose dominance.<br>
Green tech is best and most recent example. Some have lamented that the US isn’t in the lead in producing photovoltaic tech, that we import too much of the stuff from China. Yet, China doesn’t have a labor or productivity advantage here. It comes down to scale and supply-chain management, <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2013/ee/c3ee40701b">according to research</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Second, Dan looks towards Germany as a model of high tech manufacturing, but there are some caveats. Most of Germany’s manufacturing prowess <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/03/572901119/how-germany-wins-at-manufacturing-for-now">comes from small to medium sized firms</a> called Mittelstand. And the reason that Mittelstand dominate seems to come from <a href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-processing/how-does-germany-do-it">the cozy relationship</a> German manufacturing has with the Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research, often just called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society">the Fraunhofer Institutes</a>. Sixty nine of these research institutes are scattered throughout Germany and work on applied optics, chemicals, high-speed dynamics, materials, and wind energy, just to name a few.<br>
I haven’t done a deep dive yet into Dan’s writings to see if he has looked at this important link between research and output, but I hope he does. There is a lot to be learned from the German model and I am still hopeful that the lessons could be applied to US policy.</p>
