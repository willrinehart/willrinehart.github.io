<p>So, are American tech companies making it difficult for startups? Perhaps, but there are some other reasons to be skeptical.</p>
<p>First off, the nature of the venture capital market has changed due to the declining costs of computing. Not too long ago, much of a tech company’s Series A and B would be dedicated to buying  server racks and computing power. But with the advent of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other cloud computing technologies, this need has dried up.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the ecosystem? Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/venture-capital-and-the-internets-impact/">explained the impact back in 2015</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Research is only now catching up with Thompson’s hunch. In <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25188">a newly released NBER working paper</a>, economists David Byrne, Carol Corrado, Daniel E. Sichel find that prices for computing, database, and storage services offered by AWS dropped dramatically from 2009 to 2016. As they concluded, “cloud service providers are undertaking large amounts of own-account investment in IT equipment and that some of this investment may not be captured in GDP.”</p>
<p>Second, a decline in startups was predicted by Nobel winning economist Robert Lucas <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/article/rjebellje/v_3a9_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3aautumn_3ap_3a508-523.htm">back in 1978</a>. Over time, Lucas surmised, productivity increases will yield wage increases, which in turn will incentivize marginal entrepreneurs to become employees. This will increase productivity at the company, but also increases the size of the firm. Over time, as productivity and wages inch upwards, working at a firm gets incentivized over starting a company. Entrepreneurs as a portion of the economy will thus decline and industries with higher productivity rates will see bigger firms.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="http://markus-poschke.research.mcgill.ca/papers/mposchke_skillbias.pdf">analysis of 50 separate national economies</a> confirmed the inverse relationship between entrepreneurship rates and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which has also been <a href="http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?theSitePK=469382&amp;contentMDK=21485812&amp;menuPK=574960&amp;pagePK=64165401&amp;piPK=64165026">confirmed</a> by the World Bank Group Entrepreneurship Survey as well. Time series analysis also hints at this relationship. Employment within large firms tends to grow over time as a country gets wealthier. Analysis of the Census Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) illustrates this, as does <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/econ/wparchive/workpaper/vu00-w48.pdf">groundwork conducted</a> in American manufacturing from 1850 to 1880. But the United States isn’t the only country where this relationship can be found. The same trend exists for <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ytang/Huang-Pang-Tang-2014-07-14.pdf">Canada</a>, <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/notnotgep/14_2f01.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015186023309">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://waseda.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/technological-progress-by-small-and-medium-enterprises-in-japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015181911497">South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015143709196">Thailand</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the distribution of firms tends to change as a country becomes wealthier. As economist Markus Poschke noted, “richer countries thus feature fewer, larger firms, with a firm size distribution that is more dispersed and more skewed.” So, it not just the United States that has large firms. Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland all have large firms, but they too are relatively wealthy by international standards. Productivity goes a long way to explain the distributional changes.</p>
<p>Nicholas Kozeniauskas, a recent minted economist from NYU, also has been working on research showing the skewed nature of entrepreneurism, which adds some depth to this conversation. <a href="https://www.nicjkoz.com/JMP_Kozeniauskas.pdf">As he found</a>, the decline in entrepreneurship has been more pronounced for higher education levels. Overall, “an increase in fixed costs explains most of the decline in the aggregate entrepreneurship rate.”</p>
<p>As of right now, I think we should be unsatisfied with the evidence of a kill zone. The research doesn’t point in the same direction. But as new insight comes in, we will need to update, as always.</p>
