  <title> What We Learn From Past Government-Imposed Corporate Breakups Is That They Don&#39;t Work | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

Although many consider <em>Standard Oil</em> and <em>AT&amp;T</em> as classic cases, I think <em>United States v. American Tobacco Company</em> is far more instructive. </p>
<p>Like Standard Oil, the American Tobacco Company was organized as a trust and came to acquire nearly 75 percent of the total market by buying both the Union Tobacco Company and the Continental Tobacco Company. But unlike Standard Oil, as soon as these companies were bought, they were integrated within American Tobacco. In 1908 the federal government filed and eventually won a lawsuit under the Sherman Act, which dissolved the trust into three companies, which in theory matched the original three companies.<br>
Yet, the breakup wasn’t as easy as simply splitting the larger company into its original three companies, since the successor companies had intertwined processes. A single purchasing department managed the leaf purchasing. Processing plants has been assigned to specific products without any concern for their previous ownership. For eight months over tense negotiations, the government pulled apart factories, distribution and storage facilities, and name brands. Office by office, the company was pulled apart by government fiat.<br>
Historian Allan M. Brandt had this to say in <em><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Cigarette Century<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></em>,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While some might think that breaking up companies would be a clean operation, American Tobacco suggests the opposite. And I’m not alone in this assessment. Here is what Robert Crandall had to say a couple of years back <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->in a piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the Brookings Institution:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In other words, this method simply does not achieve competitive markets.<br>
