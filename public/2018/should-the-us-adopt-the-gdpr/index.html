When we started planning the event, California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) wasn’t a done deal. But now that it has passed and presents a deadline of 2020 for implementation, the terms of the privacy conversation have changed.

    <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last week, I had the honor of being a panelist at the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://itif.org/events/2018/09/25/debate-should-us-copy-eu-privacy-law"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s event<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the future of privacy regulation. The debate question was simple enough: Should the US copy the EU’s new privacy law? <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we started planning the event, California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) wasn’t a done deal. But now that it has passed and presents a deadline of 2020 for implementation, the terms of the privacy conversation have changed. Next year, 2019, Congress will have the opportunity to pass a law that could supersede the CCPA and some are looking to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for guidance. Here are some reasons for not taking that path.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GDPR imposes three kinds of costs on firms. First, the regulation forces firms to retool data processes to realign with the new demands. This is generally one time fixed cost that raises the cost of all information using entities. Second, the regime adds risk compliance costs, causing companies to staff up to ensure compliance. Finally, the law will change the dynamics of the industry, as companies adapt to the new requirements.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now, the retooling costs and the risk compliance costs are going hand in hand, so it is difficult to suss out the costs of each. Still, they are substantial. A <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/new-study-highlights-lack-of-gdpr-preparedness/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->McDermott-Ponemon survey<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on GDPR preparedness found that almost two-thirds of all companies say the regulation will “significantly change” their informational workflows. For the just over 50 percent of companies expecting to be ready for the changes, the average budget for getting to compliance tops $13 million, by this estimate. Among all the new requirements, this survey found that companies were struggling with the data-breach notification the most. The inability to comply with the notification requirement was cited by 68 percent of companies as posing the greatest risk because of the size of levied fines.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/survey-fortune-500-companies-to-spend-7-8b-on-gdpr-compliance/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->estimated the regulation will cost<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fortune 500 companies around $7.8 billion to get up to speed with the law. And these won’t be one time costs since, “Global 500 companies will be hiring on average five full-time privacy employees and filling five other roles with staff members handling compliance rules.” A <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->PwC survey<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the rule change found that 88% of companies surveyed spent more than $1 million on GDPR preparations, and 40% more than $10 million.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It might take some time to truly understand the impact of GDPR, but the law will surely change the dynamics of countless industries. For example, when the EU adopted the e-Privacy Directive in 2002, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1246"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Goldfarb and Tucker found<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that advertising became far less effective. The impact seems to have reverberated throughout the ecosystem as venture capital investment in online news, online advertising, and cloud computing dropped by <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.ceps.eu/sites/default/files/E-Privacy%20Provisions%20and%20Venture%20Capital%20Investments%20in%20the%20EU.PDF"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->between 58 to 75 percent<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Information restrictions shift consumer choices. In Chile, for example, credit bureaus were forced to stop reporting defaults in 2012, which <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w25097"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->was found<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to reduce the costs for most of the poorer defaulters, but raised the costs for non-defaulters. Overall the law lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in lending and reduced aggregate welfare.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->As the Chilean example suggests, some might benefit from a GDPR-like privacy regime. But as Daniel Castro, my co-panelist pointed out, strong privacy laws haven’t done much to sway public opinion. As <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www2.itif.org/2018-trust-privacy.pdf"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->he wrote with Alan McQuinn<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words, it doesn’t seem as though strong regulations have done anything to make people feel as though they are getting a better deal with Internet companies.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of my top concerns with the GDPR that wasn’t really discussed relates to the consent requirement in the law. Now, people must affirmatively say that data processors can use their data. As I explained at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/explaining-the-eus-general-data-protection-regulation/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->the American Action Forum<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall, I think I think there was general agreement among the panelists that the US should not adopt the GDPR. But, both Amie Stepanovich of Access Now and Justin Brookman of Consumer’s Union were generally in favor of implementing a couple of the fundamental elements of the GDPR, assuming they were adopted to the US legal system. Indeed, Access Now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->released a paper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on exactly this topic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The big question is whether the GDPR or something similar is a set of optimal rules. For countless reasons, I’m skeptical they will really improve consumer experience without imposing substantial costs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
