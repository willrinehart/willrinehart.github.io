    <p>My name is Will and I’m currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in the intersection between technology and society.</p>
<p>Before CGO, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the <a href="http://americanactionforum.org/">American Action Forum</a>. I also worked at <a href="http://techfreedom.org/">TechFreedom</a> as a Research Fellow and was previously the Director of Operations at the International Center for Law &amp; Economics. In the summer of 2009, I got my start in the world of tech policy as a Koch Summer Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation, concentrating on advertising policy and Internet governance. Previous to this, in 2008, I was a Research Associate at the Illinois Policy Institute, where I studied state-level budget, energy and tax issues. Additionally, I have worked for the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement in Chicago as the Research Assistant in Technology and Civic Engagement.</p>
<p>I am also currently a Fellow at the Internet Law &amp; Policy Foundry and a Frédéric Bastiat Fellow at the Mercatus Center. Additionally, I serve on the Federal Communications Commission’s Broadband Deployment Committee and Consumer Advocacy Committee. I also serve as an expert at the Federalist Society’s Emerging Technology Working Group, which is part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p>
<p>My work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Wired, Morning Consult, The Hill, Forbes, Reason, Marginal Revolution, Overlawyered, and on BBC Radio and NPR, just to name a few. I speak regularly on topics related to tech policy, have been cited in regulatory orders from the FCC, and have been featured in Supreme Court petitions. I hold a BA in Political Science from the University of Illinois and a MS in Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
