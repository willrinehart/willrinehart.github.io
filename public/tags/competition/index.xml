      <description>Recently, Noah Smith explored an emerging question in tech. Is there a kill zone where new and innovative upstarts are being throttled by the biggest players? He explains,
So, are American tech companies making it difficult for startups? Perhaps, but there are some other reasons to be skeptical.
First off, the nature of the venture capital market has changed due to the declining costs of computing. Not too long ago, much of a tech company’s Series A and B would be dedicated to buying server racks and computing power.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;A curious thing happened last week. Facebook’s stock, which had seem to have weathered the 2018 controversies, took a beating. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In the Washington Post, Craig Timberg and Elizabeth Dwoskin &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/26/how-years-privacy-controversies-finally-caught-up-with-facebook/?utm_term=.33e4676e4d41&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;explained&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;that the stock market drop was representative of a larger wave:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy piled on, describing the drop as “a privacy wake-up call that the markets are delivering to Mark Zuckerberg.”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;But the downward pressure was driven by more fundamental changes. Simply put, Facebook missed its earnings target. But it is important to peer into why the company didn’t meet those targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Voices from all over the political and professional spectrum have been clamoring for tech companies to be broken up. T&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;ech investor &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/roger-mcnamee-google-should-be-broken-up-into-8-companies.html&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Roger McNamee,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;machine learning pioneer Yoshua Bengio&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.axios.com/the-case-for-breaking-up-big-tech-1516625369-8695e00f-4e82-4ba1-ae89-abcd17e2a1ee.html&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;NYU professor Scott Galloway&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential digital director&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; have all suggested that tech companies should be forcibly separated. So,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; I took a look at some of the past efforts in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/a-history-of-failure-government-imposed-corporate-breakups/&#34;&gt;new survey of corporate breakups&lt;/a&gt; and found that they really weren’t all that effective at creating competitive markets.&lt;br&gt;
Although many consider &lt;em&gt;Standard Oil&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/em&gt; as classic cases, I think &lt;em&gt;United States v. American Tobacco Company&lt;/em&gt; is far more instructive. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
