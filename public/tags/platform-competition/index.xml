      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;The Supreme Court is winding down for the year and last week put out a much awaited decision in &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1454_5h26.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Ohio v. American Express&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Some have rung the alarm with this case, but I think caution is worthwhile. In short, the Court’s analysis wasn’t expansive like some have claimed, but incomplete. There are a lot of important details to this case and the guideposts it has provided will likely be fought over in future litigation over platform regulation. To narrow the scope of this post, I am going to focus on the market definition question and the issue of two-sided platforms in light of the developments in the industrial organization (IO) literature in the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
