      <description>&lt;p&gt;Economist Mariana Mazzucato has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mariana-mazzucato?fbclid=IwAR2OPxV-MNLGWJpaCSivm35lD9xkKVcSfYNB0YxO-Q9qNv9hrAAmoruiNR0&#34;&gt;full spread in the Wired UK&lt;/a&gt; humbling suggesting that she “has a plan to fix capitalism.” The plan is an outgrowth of her 2013 book &lt;em&gt;The Entrepreneurial State&lt;/em&gt;, which contends that government involvement in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), loans, and other business subsidies are the true drivers of innovation, not the private sector. Her plan is simple: governments need to do better on funding innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that the government is massively involved in innovation and for good reason. Open any introductory economics text and you’re likely to see an argument for why. Private actors are short sighted and often fail to plan for the long term by investing in R&amp;amp;D that will lead to technological progress. Basic research also might lead to advances or products outside of the company’s niche. Knowing that they won’t be able to capture all of the gains from research, private entities will choose a lower level of investment than is optimal, leading to a market failure. Governments solve this market failure by allocating resources to expanding scientific and technological knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mazzucato might be finding an audience with policy makers in the UK and doers in Silicon Valley, innovation economists are a little more wary of her state first theory of innovation. Here are some things worth considering when reading her work:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
