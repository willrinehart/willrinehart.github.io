  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

 Throughout most of the colonial era, however, there was no system of partisan politics to support partisan journalism. And with only a limited local demand for their services, printers typically maximized their potential clients and advertisers by not taking sides in local controversies… Printers avoided offending the powerful by keeping divisive issues entirely out of their newspapers, stifling debate rather than promoting it." />
