  <title> The Metaphors of Common(ers) | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

<meta property="og:description" content="I have been following a bit of this Common controversy and it just hit me that white people do not understand rap music can be metaphorical. I was think of the opposite side of this. Even if Common was making “cop killing” and incendiary remarks against Bush, that does not mean that he was going to do it. It is an allegory. Just because you kill someone in a lyric or a play or a movie, that does not mean that you hate them." />

    <p>I have been following a bit of this Common controversy and it just hit me that white people do not understand rap music can be metaphorical. I was think of the opposite side of this. Even if Common was making “cop killing” and incendiary remarks against Bush, that does not mean that he was going to do it. It is an allegory. Just because you kill someone in a lyric or a play or a movie, that does not mean that you hate them. It is an exploration, and a visceral one at that, of the tendencies of life. Metaphorically expressed violence contemplates our physically expressed violence. Denying this also means denying the existence of violence. It is truly a white washing of the issues.</p>
