Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation.

Regardless, I think it was deplorable on the part of white America to care about Troy Davis. And for those who poured out grief, you, comrade, have no clue. Of course we had to care, he was a perfect victim." />

<p>Regardless, I think it was deplorable on the part of white America to care about Troy Davis. And for those who poured out grief, you, comrade, have no clue. Of course we <em>had</em> to care, he was a perfect victim. The evidence was undeniable. He was more than likely innocent and that is the point. The American media and most of mainstream society only cares about this issue when we are presented with a perfect victim. For all of those who are not so clearly innocent, well, we have no use for you. Oh, we use insanely brutal police tactics in Black and Latino neighborhoods? Meh. We have the longest sentences in the Western world? Meh. We put huge numbers of Blacks in jail? Meh.</p>
