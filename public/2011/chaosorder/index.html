  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

    <p>The remnants from the Enlightenment project sill impose a constraint on our thinking. Two of the core tenants that we have inherited are that</p>
<ol>
<li>there is an order/harmony, and</li>
<li>it precedes our existence in it</li>
</ol>
<p>This continues to be one of the defining features of Western thought. Campbell, in his glorious contribution to this side of criticism, made note of the difference between the East and the West in this regard. In our origin story, God establishes time in the same breath that he/she creates the animals and humanity. Order, then, is created. For the East, however, this is not the case. Much like Plato’s version of creation, first there is one. Then this one separates itself, creating animals, etc. There is no implication of order or even of time, both are seen as multiplicities, as constructs that we place upon the world.</p>
