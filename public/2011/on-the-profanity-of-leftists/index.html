  <title> On the Profane | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

The opposite of this is the profane, which is the utilitarian, individualistic world that we all inhabit. To see it another way, the profane revolves around the concerns of the individuals, while the sacred includes the concerns of the community. As Durkheim explained, people feel that the moral truths of the sacred are far more important than just personal preferences." />

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The opposite of this is the profane, which is the utilitarian, individualistic world that we all inhabit. To see it another way, the profane revolves around the concerns of the individuals, while the sacred includes the concerns of the community. As Durkheim explained, people feel that the moral truths of the sacred are far more important than just personal preferences. Because they exist outside of the self and in the community, they command respect. He connected this respect with authority.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As he famously said, “God is society writ large.” God is society because God is this superior voice, which in turn is just society.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment changed the sacred/profane relationship by emphasizing each person’s individual worth. Beginning with the American and French Revolutions, there has been a general upward trend in the advancement of individual rights, beginning first with men and then extending to women and minority rights. And around these rights, modern social institutions have been built. Public school, Medicare, and Social Security all reinforce the worth of the individual.</p>
<p>To bring this to the point at hand, I am beginning to think that many see many modern institutions as being sacred. These are not just public services, they are “ritualistic ways of behavior that are valued beyond whatever utility they may possess.” To dismantle them is not just to reform government or cut back on spending but to destroy a specific sacred space.</p>
