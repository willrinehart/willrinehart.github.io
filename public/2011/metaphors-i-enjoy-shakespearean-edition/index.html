  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

 Is the debt ceiling really an issue that needs to be negotiated? Or, is it part of a horrible game?" />

<p>Is the debt ceiling really an issue that needs to be negotiated? Or, is it part of a horrible game? Adding in women to the mix would be interesting, but the rules have already been set.</p>
<p>Let’s consider some truths. Congress has already passed the budget. Now, they are saying, no we are not going to raise this arbitrary limit we have put on the debt because of President Obama’s reckless spending. Who exactly passes the budget? Oh yes, Congress. It is a game of posturing. I think I saw this once on the Discovery Channel between some chimps.</p>

<p>The big benefit of the Boehner plan is that it is seen to be <em>imposed</em> – and the current GOP mindset is that it’s better to gain less by show of force than to get more by negotiation.</p>
