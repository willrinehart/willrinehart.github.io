  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, Iâ€™m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

<meta property="og:description" content="From Eureka The Birth of Science by Andrew Gregory:
 The philosopher Empedocles of Acragas introduced the four elements of earth, water, air and fire, which were to become standard in Greek thought. These should not be understood as literally earth, water, and so on, but in a slightly more abstract manner as solid, liquid, gas and fire or as principles of solidity, fluidity, gasesousness and fieriness.

<p>Some things not new but worth reviewing and remembering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logic is about finding the correct form of an argument not the correct content of it</li>
<li>Empeiria is skill to do something whereas episteme is knowledge of why it occurs</li>
