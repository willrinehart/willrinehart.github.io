  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

<p>In reality, Americans get a mix of all this from their government. We get some totally legit public goods. We get certain goods and services, generally at a reduced level of quality, that some people would have paid for anyway but others can’t afford. We get a lot of straight-up destruction of wealth and welfare from deadweight loss, negative-sum transfers, and stupid wars. We get a lamentable amount of authoritarian police state infrastructure and activity. If we could cut in half the percentage of the budget dedicated to stupid wars and Gestapo stuff, I’d happily accept a permanent 5% increase in the size of government devoted entirely to digging vast holes and filling them in. Freedom isn’t free!</p>

<p>This paragraph spurred me on to think about policing. We have a smaller government compared to Western Europe, but the police state here is much worse than anywhere in Europe. I am not completely sure why it is that policing has gotten so bad, so here are a couple of theories, not wholly unrelated</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a natural connexion between American individualism and lower levels of trust resulting in a need for higher levels of policing</li>
<li>American ideology blinds us to the reality of various policing practices and the government (via public choice) has a natural tendency to expand</li>
<li>The prison industrial complex has its own sort of demands for continuing profits and for more prisoners</li>
<li>Discrimination has been institutionalized</li>
</ol>
