<p>With the worst of the economic crisis behind us, social commentators like Judt are calling for action, demanding that leaders and society change to advert another economic crisis. Sadly, this is yet another lofty aspiration based on fallacious Enlightenment ideals. Humans cannot be perfected. Grinding poverty, brutal violence and unequal power relationships are the true characterizations of the human condition. Just as “the obsession with wealth creation, the cult of privatization and the private sector, the growing disparities of rich and poor” is not natural, neither is its opposite.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most in the discussion of the crisis is the belief that a more comprehensive design in economic regulation or politics will yield a better outcome. If the last 500 years is any indication, every ten years or so there will be a small economic downturn, and every thirty, there will be a larger and more destructive one.</p>
