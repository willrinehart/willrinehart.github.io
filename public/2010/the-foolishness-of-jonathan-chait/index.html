<p>The belief that any regulation could prevent the next crisis is foolish. Like clockwork, there has been an economic downturn every ten years for the last 400 years, at least. Even though he is not willing to come right out and say it, Chait does seem to admit the futility of tough regulation. As he says, these reforms “could possibly prove useless.” And yet, despite this, he calls for the “the toughest, most anti-Wall Street reform possible.”</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This has always been one of the things I’ve wondered about outwardly partisan hacks like Chait. Why, given the fallibility of the regulation, is it still pushed forward? And more generally, why is some regulation better than none? Chait is being quite disingenuous here, but I think his views aren’t far from those of the mainstream, which really scares me.</p>
