  <title> Forget About Too Little Information or Too Much Information, Think About Search Costs | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

    <p>Poking around Cory Doctrow’s Tumblr site today, I came across a <a href="http://mostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com/post/55569865678/for-most-of-the-human-race-pretty-much-all-of-the">Neil Gaiman quote</a>:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From too little information to too much information in just a few short years? Presumably then, at some point there was a Goldilocks era when we had exactly the right amount of information. So, when exactly was that, 1998 or thereabouts? Gaiman’s rhetorical use of too much and too little information hardly makes sense when considered in finer detail.</p>
<p>True, there is more information today than ever. <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata/">Almost 90% of all data</a> in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. And yes, there is a lot to experience, yet, there is a serious dearth of <em>useful</em> information, as there always has been. Useful information, information that push forward a project or make a difference in saving lives is costly. For individuals, it means pushing yourself further on the learning curve. For firms, it means the adoption of new management practices. Concerns about too much or too little information are orthogonal to a more important line of questioning: what are the costs in searching for the answer.</p>
