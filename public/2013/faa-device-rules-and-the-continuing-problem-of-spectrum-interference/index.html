    <p>This was bound to happen: the proliferation of mobile devices is beginning to cause the “incidents” involving airline passengers to rack up. From <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/f-a-a-rules-make-electronic-devices-on-planes-dangerous/">Nick Bilton</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At issue is the largely unproven idea that tablets and phones interfere with a plane’s computers and communication devices. But, the asymmetry in rules for flight and takeoff is especially peculiar. When electromagnetic interference does happen with mobile devices, it is usually limited to a narrowband of the spectrum, due to inadequate filtering, tuning, or poor frequency control. The bands dedicated to aeronautical communication and telemetry are <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OPP/working_papers/oppwp38chart.pdf">largely devoid</a> of adjacent mobile ones, which does reduce the potential risk. Moreover, if there were interference problems of this sort, one would assume that they would happen during takeoff, landing <em>and</em> in-flight. Admittedly I am no aeronautical engineer, but I am not sure what kind of case for interference would make just takeoff and landing more risky.</p>
<p>Adjacent band interference was at the center of another debate in early 2012: LightSquared’s troubles with GPS devices. Ultimately, the company could not deploy their 4G network because of <a href="http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=860737">the interference problems</a> it created for GPS devices, but these were known problems that LightSquared tried to innovate around. As the piece explains, the FAA announced in October that it would review its policies on the use of electronic devices during all stages of flight due partially to Chairman Genachowski’s instance. Being chastised by the FCC that you need to review your rules is bad, especially considering that it still had a number of outdated telegraph laws on the books until the late 1990s. Perhaps others might be able to comment, but I am at a loss to describe the harm imposed by the rules. Sure these rules are inconvenient, but they are actually better at showing the regulatory inertia whenever any rule is adopted, which should make us all a little more wary.</p>
