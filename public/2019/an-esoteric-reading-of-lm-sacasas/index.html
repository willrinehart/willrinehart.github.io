    <p>After reading LM Sacasas’ recent piece on <a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2019/02/20/token-ethicists-and-non-existent-moral-communities/">moral communities</a>, I couldn’t help but wonder if the piece was written in the <a href="https://econjwatch.org/articles/a-beginner-s-guide-to-esoteric-reading">esoteric mode</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain by some meandering.</p>
<p>Now, I am surely going to butcher his argument, so take a read of it yourself, but there is a bit of an interesting call and response structure to the piece. He begins with commentary on “frequent deployment of <a href="http://thefrailestthing.com/2017/12/03/the-rhetorical-we-and-the-ethics-of-technology/">the rhetorical we</a>,” in discussions over the morality of technology. Then, channeling Langdon Winner, he notes approvingly that “What matters here is that this lovely ‘we’ suggests the presence of a moral community that may not, in fact, exist at all, at least not in any coherent, self-conscious form.”</p>
<p>He is right, the use of the rhetorical we helps to construct a community, which he thens deploys later in the piece. To see this in action,</p>

<p>Before becoming a policy analyst, I went to graduate school at the University of Illinois at Chicago and studied communication, which at the time was transitioning away from the influence of former dean Stanley Fish and becoming a new media study program. The staff was and still is excellent, but at the time it was deeply heterodox, including both old school rhetoricians and literary scholars as well as communication historians, and communication sociologists.</p>
<p>All of this background is to say that Sacasas’ charge that “we have taken it for granted and have consequently done very little thinking about technology with regards to society,” depends a lot on the kind of community you call your own and how you understand community.</p>
<p>My former community, communication scholars, has a long history of exploring these questions. Indeed, one of my favorite classes was <a href="https://zizi.people.uic.edu/Site/Courses_files/DemInDigAgeSyllabus.pdf">an introductory survey course on democracy and technology</a>. But Sacasas all too well knows that community. I don’t think he was intending to suggest those kind of <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/26277">counterpublics</a> when suggesting community. As he notes, “There is no moral community or public space in which technological issues are topics for deliberation, debate, and shared action.” Here, he means moral community as it comes to us from Durkheim. Just as a reminder, moral community in this tradition generally <a href="http://faculty.msmc.edu/lindeman/mc.html">references</a> “those beings that you need to think ‘but is this right’ before you do something that could affect them.” In other words, questions over the morality of technology are not attended by the kinds of questions that constitute a moral community. I want to come back to this point later.</p>
<p>Where does this leave us? He further explains,</p>

<p>In other words, Sacasas sets up a governance <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acts-Reading-Patricia-Harkin/dp/0130429384">gap problem</a>. There are micro-level solutions and macro-level solutions, but nothing in the middle that might emanate from a moral community. But, again, the fundamental criticism of this entire argument hinges on accepting the rhetorical we and the notion of a community. Or, to say it another way, a community must first be constructed for a governance gap to exist. If we don’t agree to the rhetorical construction of community, if there is no we, then there is no gap to fill. This is no small feat. Even Durkheim’s original understanding of moral community was a subjective understanding of the ethics of an imagined community.</p>
<p>But even separate from the construction problem, it is not clear to me that there isn’t already “a cocktail of strategies that address the consequences of technology as they manifest themselves across the spectrum of scale.” For example, Facebook changed its policy on breastfeeding photos after a group of mothers organized and pushed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/02/26/facebook-is-embroiled-in-yet-another-breastfeeding-photo-controversy/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.875bce6ac31b">the #FreeTheNipple campaign</a>. I cannot help but wonder if that is the kind of community driven strategy that Sacasas would want to promote.</p>
<p>That notoriously nebulous concept of civil society is worth invoking here. Organizations like <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> and <a href="https://epic.org/">EPIC</a> and <a href="https://www.freepress.net/">FreePress</a> sue platforms and local governments, and help enact change. And what about all of the reports from journalists in the last decade? They have impacted both Facebook and Google, forcing them to change. Same with Apple and AT&amp;T and Verizon. All of this is to say, I’m not exactly convinced this vision of the world is the appropriate yardstick of critique.</p>
