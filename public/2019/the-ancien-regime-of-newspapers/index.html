<p>Of course there is variability in the marketplace, but it does seem like many newspapers had few problems keeping payroll in the period before the Internet. Larry’s larger point is still valid. For years, news organizations faced little competition, only to now be faced with leaner alternatives in recent times. Reading the histories of the newspaper industry leads to the belief that the writers had far greater distance from their consumers. In the academy and especially in the political economy of media crowd, this distance is lauded, because it allows for a gatekeeper role and helps to grease the wheels of democracy.</p>
