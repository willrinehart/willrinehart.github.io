  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State.

<meta property="og:description" content="Will Oremus dissects that often repeated phrase, if you aren’t paying, you’re the product. While the piece is stellar, I don’t really agree with Oremus when he says that an alternative vision would “view ourselves as customers of Facebook, paying with our time, attention, and data instead of with money.” That assumes a payment system. Instead we should think of it as exchange. For better or worse, we still use the rhetoric of payments." />

    <p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/are-you-really-facebooks-product-the-history-of-a-dangerous-idea.html">Will Oremus dissects</a> that often repeated phrase, if you aren’t paying, you’re the product. While the piece is stellar, I don’t really agree with Oremus when he says that an alternative vision would “view ourselves as customers of Facebook, paying with our time, attention, and data instead of with money.” That assumes a payment system. Instead we should think of it as exchange. For better or worse, we still use the rhetoric of payments. Rather, we should understand it as a barter. In economics the term is double coincidence of wants. We exchange because we each have something the other wants.</p>

<p>By way of someone, here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=pW-SOdj4Kkk">a talk from Jonathan Blow</a> about the importance of tacit knowledge. In it, Blow recalls a section from Robert Colwell’s <a href="http://newsletter.sigmicro.org/sigmicro-oral-history-transcripts/Bob-Colwell-Transcript.pdf">oral history</a>, about the loss of knowledge in the early computer industry:</p>

<p>Are AI worries overblown? <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/27/book-review-reframing-superintelligence/">Scott Alexander is coming around to the idea</a> and I think you should too. Also, here is a great section: Paul Christiano “worries that AI services will be naturally better at satisfying objective criteria than at ‘making the world better’ in some vague sense. Tasks like ‘maximize clicks to this site’ or ‘maximize profits from this corporation” are objective criteria; tasks like ‘provide real value to users of this site instead of just clickbait’ or ‘have this corporation act in a socially responsible way’ are vague. That means AI may asymmetrically empower some of the worst tedencies in our society without giving a corresponding power increase to normal people just trying to live enjoyable lives. In his model, one of the tasks of AI safety research is to get AIs to be as good at optimizing vague prosocial tasks as they will naturally be at optimizing the bottom line.”</p>
<p>In CityLab, <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/08/commute-time-city-size-transportation-urban-planning-history/597055/?utm_campaign=citylab-daily-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;silverid=%25%25RECIPIENT_ID%25%25&amp;utm_source=newsletter">Jonathan English explains the Marchetti Constant</a>, the general finding that people are willing to commute for about a half-hour, one way, each day.</p>
<p>“The Internet is marked by an unholy intimacy between readers and writers. By the simple act of tweeting an article, or sharing on Facebook, readers can address all parties simultaneously: writers, editors, publishers, and the world. And in thus sharing, readers can be ‘glib, disingenuous, mocking, cruel, pedantic, self-righteous, and derogatory.’ Flippancy, ‘that most hopeless form of intellectual vice,’ say the editors, ‘cares for nothing but what can be made a matter of ridicule.’ Internet reading, thus, is marked by bad habits: impatience, deliberate misreadings, mindlessly admiring repetition, or trollish ill will. In the frantic give and take, conclude the N+1 editors, ‘we are left with little sovereignty over our own opinions.'” (<a href="https://rolandnikles.blogspot.com/2018/09/sovereign-of-my-opinions.html?spref=tw">link</a>)</p>
