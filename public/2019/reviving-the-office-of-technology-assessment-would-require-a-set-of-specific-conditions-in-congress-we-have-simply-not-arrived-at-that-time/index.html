    <p>Cato Unbound is taking on the issue of tech expertise this month and the lead essay came from Kevin Kosar, who argues for the revival of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Technology_Assessment">the Office of Technology Assessment</a>. <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2019/06/10/kevin-kosar/congresss-tech-policy-knowledge-gap">As he explains</a>,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He continues, “Congress’s ineptitude in [science and technology policy] has been richly displayed.” To help embed expertise in science and technology policy, Kosar argues for the revival of the Office of Technology Assessment, which was established in 1972 and defunded in 1995.</p>
<p>I have been on the OTA beat for a little while now, and so I offered some criticism of Kosar’s proposal, <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2019/06/14/will-rinehart/political-economy-expertise">which you can find here</a>. I’ll lay out my cards: <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/should-congress-revive-the-office-of-technology-assessment/">I’ve been skeptical of reving the OTA</a> in the past and I remain so. Here is my key graf on that:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The OTA wasn’t supposed to be <em>just</em> a tech assessment office, but also an outside government agency that could check the Executive. The legislative history underpins that goal:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The demand for the OTA at its genesis was twofold, for knowledge as Kosar explains, but also for power. I doubt Democrats or the Republicans today would “simply to accede to administration initiatives,” as both had a tendency to do in the 1960s. The agency was created at a time when both sides of Congress wanted to check the president. It was a solution to an intertwined set of problems. While the tenor in Congress could swiftly change, a groundswell of bipartisan support for an OTA would be needed before any efforts to revive it could be effective. A revival would need to be a compromise that both parties and both chambers of Congress could agree to. We have simply not arrived at that time.</p>
<p>But there are solutions to sidestep the reinvigoration of a standalone agency. In line with my <a href="https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/should-congress-revive-the-office-of-technology-assessment/">suggestions from last year</a>, the General Accounting Office is expanding their tech assessment program. Congress also needs to reform their staffing processes to encourage stability and reduce turnover. None of these proposals, however, will make headway in changing congressional offices back toward their orientation in the early 1990s. In a follow up post over at Cato, I will explore the challenges that any reform will face when trying to solve the problem of tech expertise.</p>
