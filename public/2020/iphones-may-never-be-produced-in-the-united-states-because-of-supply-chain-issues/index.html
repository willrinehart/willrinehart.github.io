<p>The original <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/06/09/159456/the-all-american-iphone/">MIT Technology Review</a> article on which the cite is taken also makes a similar kind of assumption. Chinese wages are lower and so they can make stuff much cheaper. End of story.</p>
<p>I tend to think there’s more.</p>
<p>Last year, the New York Times <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ran an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I wished more people read, titled, “A Tiny Screw Shows Why iPhones Won’t Be ‘Assembled in U.S.A.'” The thrust of the piece was simple, but powerful if you understand how important supply chains are. Near the beginning, the authors laid out the problems Apple was having with a previous version of the Mac Pro, and in doing so, diagnosed a central issue with U.S. manufacturing:</p>

<p>There are other examples. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in solar photovoltaic manufacturing suggests that, “The historical price advantage of a China-based factory relative to a U.S.-based factory is not driven by country-specific advantages [like low labor cost], but instead by scale and supply-chain development.” If policy makers are actually serious about bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. they should be talking about what it really requires, deep supply chains.</p>
