      <description>Contemporary tech criticism displays an anti-nostalgia. Instead of being reverent for the past, anxiety about the future abounds. In these visions, the future is imagined as a strange, foreign land, beset with problems. And yet, to quote that old adage, tomorrow is the visitor that is always coming but never arrives. The future never arrives because we are assembling it today.
The distance between the now and the future finds its hook in tech policy in the pacing problem, a term describing the mismatch between advancing technologies and society’s efforts to cope with them.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;To read Cathy O’Neil’s &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;(2016) is to experience another in a line of progressive pugilists of the technological age. Where Tim Wu took on &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Future-Internet-How-Stop/dp/0300151241&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;the future of the Internet&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;and Evgeny Morozov &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Net-Delusion-Dark-Internet-Freedom/dp/1610391063&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;chided online slactivism&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, O’Neil takes on algorithms, or what she has dubbed weapons of math destruction (WMD).&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;O’Neil’s book came at just the right moment in 2016. It sounded the alarm about big data just as it was becoming a topic for public discussion. And now, two years later, her worries seem prescient. As she explains in the introduction,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;O’Neil is explicit about laying out the blame at the feet of the WMDs, “You cannot appeal to a WMD. That’s part of their fearsome power. They do not listen.” Yet, these models aren’t deployed and adopted in a frictionless environment. Instead, they “reflect goals and ideology” as O’Neil readily admits. Where &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;falters is that it ascribes too much agency to algorithms in places, and in doing so misses the broader politics behind algorithmic decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
