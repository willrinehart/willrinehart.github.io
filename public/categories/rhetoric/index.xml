Who knows of the sincerity of the post, but that’s Breezewood, PA. It’s a hellish place when I-70 comes to a grinding halt before it dumps into the Penna Turnpike. There should be a proper interchange between the two, and yet, Breezewood lives on as a series of red lights.

Accordingly, pathos meant both to suffer and to experience. In a small way, this study supports this ancient line of thought.</description>
