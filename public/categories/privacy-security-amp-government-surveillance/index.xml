      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Reading professor Siva Vaidhyanathan’s &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/facebook-sandberg-congress.html&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;recent op-ed&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;in the New York Times, one could reasonably assume that Facebook is now seriously tackling the enormous problem of dangerous information.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;But it could be that, in their zeal to trapple down criticism from all sides, Facebook instead has corrected too far and is now over-moderating. The fundamental problem is that it is nearly impossible to know the true amount of disinformation on a platform. For one, there is little agreement on what kind of content needs to be policed. It is doubtful everyone would agree what constitutes fake news and separates it from disinformation or propaganda and how all of that differs from hate speech. But more fundamentally, even if everyone agreed to what should be taken down, it is still not clear that algorithmic filtering methods would be able to perfectly approximate that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carpenter v.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;United&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a case involving the cell-site location information. In the 5 to 4 decision, the Court declared that “The Government’s acquisition of Carpenter’s cell-site records was a Fourth Amendment search.” What follows below is a roundup of reactions and comments to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
