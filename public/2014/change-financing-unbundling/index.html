  <title> What Economic Environment Will TV Unbundling Create? | Will Rinehart</title>

    <p>The Technology Policy Institute just went live with a video of their <a href="http://www.techpolicyinstitute.org/events/show/118.html">OTT event</a>, exploring TV unbundling. There is a lot of solid material, but Laura Martin, a Senior Analyst at Needham &amp; Company, explained what would happen if we went to an unbundled world:</p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as you unbundle, you lose advertising revenue. Immediately, you have to double the cost because of lost ad dollars.</li>
<li>1/2 of the revenues come from ads and the other 1/2 comes from subscription.</li>
<li>Currently, the market is $150 billion a year for TV revenue with a $400 billion in market cap.</li>
<li>Remember, in order for Nielson to measure for ads and thus calculate ad dollars, you have to reach 20 million homes.</li>
<li>By her projections, only 30 channels of 500 would reach this number. So, the other 400 or so would have to double their costs to consumers.</li>
<li>Currently, everyone one of those channels reaches the homes out of the 150 million, and there is an easy way to change channels.</li>
<li>Subscriptions are 5 year terms and tend to step up over time.</li>
<li>So, advertising moves away from TV the fastest in a la carte world.</li>
<li>Currently, the cost of content is $40 per household and what we would see is about 15 channels, which is generally the average around the world.</li>
<li>Everyone does consume the major 15 channels, but households tend to have passion channels that will lose out in this world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bruce Owen also noted that if we force suppliers to provide services a la carte, then how do we know if they are pricing the various channels correctly? We will have to look at costs because supplying the bundle costs less than supplying the a la carte channels. So, we are in a world of rate regulation.</p>
