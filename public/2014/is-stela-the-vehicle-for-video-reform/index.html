    <p>Even though few things are getting passed this Congress, the pressure is on to reauthorize the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act (STELA) before it expires at the end of this year. Unsurprisingly, many have hoped this “must pass bill” will be the vehicle for broader reform of video. Getting video law right is important for our content rich world, but the discussion needs to expand much further than STELA.</p>
<p>Over at the American Action Forum, I <a href="http://americanactionforum.org/insights/stela-reauthorization-highlights-need-for-video-reform">explore a bit</a> of what would be needed, and just how far the problems are rooted:</p>

<p>In the effort to support specific “public interest” goals, the FCC has implemented certain regulations which have cabined both broadcasters and paid TV distributors. In turn, these regulations forced companies to develop in proscribed ways, and in turn prompted further regulatory action when they have tried to innovate. Speaking about this cat-and-mouse game in the financial sector, Professor <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/1996/021596.htm">Edward Kane termed</a> the relationship, the “regulatory dialectic.”<br>
But unwrapping the regulatory dialectic in video law will require a vehicle far more expansive than STELA. Ultimately, I conclude,</p>
