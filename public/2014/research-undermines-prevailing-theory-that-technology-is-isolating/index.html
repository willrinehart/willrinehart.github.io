  <title> Research Undermines Prevailing Theory that Technology is Isolating | Will Rinehart</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My name is William Rinehart, but you can call me Will. Currently, I’m a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity (CGO) at Utah State. Previously, I was the Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum. In my day to day job, I specialize on the public policy of telecommunication, the Internet, platform companies, and AI, with a focus on emerging technologies and innovation. Fundamentally, I am interested in expanding human flourishing, reforming government to make it efficient, and learning.">

    <p>An ever-present theme in the commentary of modern technology is its isolating effect. Yet the truth is far more complex. This <a href="http://bostonreview.net/blog/claude-fischer-all-tech-is-social">Boston Review article</a> on technology points to a <a href="http://www.mysocialnetwork.net/downloads/Change%20in%20the%20social%20life%20of%20urban%20public%20spaces.pdf">paper</a> supported by the Annenberg School of Communication that seems to suggest we are becoming more social. By conducting a content analysis of films from four public spaces over a thirty-year period, the behavior and characteristics of 143,593 people were coded. A couple of key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importantly, people are spending less time alone and increasingly more time in groups.</li>
<li>Women are now far more prevalent in public spaces, while men and women tend to spend more time together in public.</li>
<li>Despite the ubiquity of mobile phones, their rate of use in public is relatively small.</li>
<li>Mobile phones users appear less often in spaces where there are more groups, and most often in spaces where people might otherwise be walking alone.</li>
<li>Mobile phone use is associated with reduced public isolation, although it is associated with an increased likelihood to linger and with time spent lingering in public.</li>
<li>The increased tendency to spend time in groups while in public contrasts with evidence from other research that suggests a decline in American public life, and that mobile phones have increased social isolation in public spaces.</li>
<li>The increase in group behavior, women, and lingering in public may have positive implications for engagement within the public sphere.</li>
</ul>
