<meta property="og:description" content="As you might recall, the Stanford Prison Experiment pitted several student against each other as randomly chosen prison guards or prisoners.

The experiment is a classic note in psychology texts and has often been used to explain the Nazis, Abu Ghraib, and other forms of inhumane practices.
Apparently, there are serious flaws with the study." />
